    "body": "Diane Arbus (1923-71) is among the most revered photographers in the history of the medium. A pioneer of the social documentary form that blurred the line between art and reportage, her profoundly original works record the astonishing variety of attitudes, emotions and appearances to be found amongst the people around us. Her portraits of children, circus performers, nudists, families, famous people, transvestites down-and-outs and couples are united by their sometimes shocking directness. This frank, unflinching approach reflects Arbus' method, which relied upon a sense of trust between the artist and sitter.\n\nArbus studied photography during the 1940s and '50s in New York and her first published photograph appeared in 'Esquire' in 1960. She began making portraits in the early 1960s, and was the recipient of two Guggenheim Fellowships, before embarking on a project to create a series of limited editions of her work in 1970. Tragically, she committed suicide in 1970, shortly after the first 'Box of Ten' was produced. Fewer than 10 known copies of this work were printed before the artist's death, making the body of work in ARTIST ROOMS - put together in collaboration with the artist's daughter and the trustees of her estate - one of the best collections in existence in public or private hands.",

    "title": "Louise Bourgeois",
    "body": "Louise Bourgeois (1911-2010) was a French-American sculptor, painter and printmaker whose confessional, autobiographical approach to art left behind one of the most extraordinary bodies of work of the past century.\n\nBorn into a family of tapestry restorers in Paris, Bourgeois moved to New York when she married Robert Goldwater, the author of 'Primitivism in Modern Art', in 1938. In the early years of her long career (she continued to make art until her death in 2010, at the age of 98), Bourgeois worked and exhibited with artists as varied as the Surrealists Joan Miró, André Masson and the Abstract Expressionists Willem de Kooning, Jackson Pollock and Mark Rothko. In spite of her proximity to the prevailing movements of her time, Bourgeois developed her own unique, unconventional approach, premised upon the creation of symbolic objects loaded with profoundly personal significance and her own experience of psychoanalysis.\n\nCharacterised by themes of isolation, abandonment, childhood trauma and vulnerability, Bourgeois’ works are, despite the variety of the materials in which they are realised, focused on the human body and our desperate need for love and protection. The body is often, in her sculpture as in her paintings and works on paper, presented as trapped, tortured or transfigured: an explicitly physical expression of psychological pain.\n\nOften overlooked in the early part of her career, Bourgeois achieved a wider audience from the 1970s onwards, due in part to new readings of her work by influential feminist critics. Her reputation increased steadily in the coming decades, abetted by the astonishing power, mystery and beauty of her late work, which is represented in the ARTIST ROOMS collection by, among other things, important fabric works, a series of 16 drawings, 'A L'Infini', and her final vitrine, produced in the last year of her life.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge the generosity of the Easton Foundation in gifting 'Triptych for The Red Room' and 'Femme' to Tate for the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "body": "Martin Creed (b. 1968) is among the most restlessly creative artists at work today. He takes commonplace events and objects as the subject of, and the material for, art that celebrates everyday life. His magpie enthusiasm for the beautiful and strange all about us is expressed in a wide variety of forms, including performance, film, painting, installation and music.\n\nSome of Creed's works are very large, and some are very small. Some are easily recognisable as art - paintings and drawings - while others are not - a scrunched up ball of paper, or the lights going on and off in an otherwise empty room. All of them are nonetheless identified primarily by a number, granting them equal status irrespective of their size or fame. This democratic spirit is indicative of Creed's approach to art and the world around us, open to the possibility that the most insignificant-seeming thing can be a source of beauty and wonder, and should be treated as such.\n\nThis generosity of spirit is also evident in Creed's donation of a significant body of work to the ARTIST ROOMS collection to ensure its continued availability to the nation. This includes the neon sign 'Work No. 890 (DON’T WORRY)', a twenty-one part drawing, 'Work No. 944' (2008), and a series of four paintings from 2011.",

    "title": "Georg Baselitz",
    "body": "Born in Dresden in 1938, Georg Baselitz is one of the major artists to come out of the former East Germany, and among the leading figures who helped to re-establish German painting after World War II.\n\nHe first achieved notoriety for his ‘Pandemonium’ paintings in the early 1960s. Here he described the chaos from which order might, or might not come, evoking insantity, irrationality, paranoia, illness, decay, sex, drink and violence in a great blast of fury. He later became known for his roughly carved wooden sculptures and for the ‘fracture’ paintings, in which figures are divided in various ways (including being chopped up as if by a forester’s axe). In the 1960s his subjects often have a specifically Germanic, Nordic subject matter, tattered partisans, soldiers, forests which conceal them, folklore, foresters, animals… Over time he established a group of archetypes which he has continued to return to: the tree, the bird, the knee, the hand, the friend, the rebel, the poet, the shepherd, the soldier, the woodman, together with their domestic animals, carts and ploughs.\n\nIn the 1970s he took the decision to paint his subjects upside down in order to liberate both the subject and the expressive qualities of the medium. This approach again caused controversy, but enabled Baselitz to carve his own unique path in German post-war art. His painterly approach has evolved constantly over the years, often influenced by African sculpture of which he has a large collection.\n\n'Where is the Yellow Milk Jug, Mrs Bird?' and 'Folkdance Melancholia' in ARTIST ROOMS belong to a series of works the artist made in 1989 at his home at Derneburg, in the countryside of Lower Saxony. They are fine examples of the ecstatic painting of this period in which leitmotifs of falling birds, milk jugs and disembodied heads conjure up a world of primitive folkloric culture, their tumbling forms filling the canvas with a sense of rhythm and ornament.",

A principal figure in twentieth-century Minimalism, along with his friends and compatriots Sol LeWitt and Donald Judd (though he himself resisted the categorisation), Flavin used sculpture and installation to investigate the properties and effects of pure light.\n\nHis breakthrough work was 'the diagonal of May 25, 1963 (to Constantin Brancusi)', which consists of a mounted, coloured fluorescent tube fixed directly to the wall. Flavin continued throughout his career to dedicate his sculptures to artists and philosophers he admired, among the most famous of which are his series of tower-shaped sculptures named after the Russian avant-garde artist and architect Vladimir Tatlin.\n\nFlavin’s 'monuments' (1964-1990), included in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, are among his most austere works, composed only of cool white fluorescent tubes and eschewing the brilliant colours that were later associated with his work. An art historian by education, Flavin’s work combines a powerful simplicity (he used only commercially available fluorescent tubing in standard sizes, shapes, and colours) with intellectual sophistication to create a body of work that is a product of both thought and emotion.",

    "body": "The Latvian-born artist Vija Celmins (b. 1938) uses a variety of media including charcoal, graphite and erasers to produce exquisitely intricate work which includes paintings, drawings and prints based on photographs of natural phenomena, notably the sea, deserts and the night sky. Her painstakingly slow method of composition is characterised by the extraordinary precision of her approach, and her persistent return to certain subjects. Based upon close observation, her delicate-seeming work addresses subjects that are powerful, timeless and seemingly complex beyond our comprehension.\n\nThe seminal drawing 'Web #1' in ARTIST ROOMS is typical of her apparently fragile, ephemeral images and is the first of nine works on the theme of the spider’s web made between 1998 and 2006. It is accompanied by a series of four ‘web’ prints from 2001 and 2002. These images echo the web-like construction of the universe, another of the artist's preoccupations. Among other works in the collection are a series of prints from the 1980s, 'Concentric Bearings', and two negative images of night-skies in which the sky appears white and star formations are transformed into black markings. All these works focus on something small and individual in the context of vastness. The images they depict seem fragile because they record a specific human glimpse through a telescope or camera which is ephemeral and frozen in time.\n\nTate and the National Galleries Scotland would like to thank the artist for her generosity in donating the aquatint, mezzotint and drypoint on paper ‘Alliance’, the mezzotints ‘Web Ladder’, ‘Starfield’, ‘Divided Night Sky’, ‘Fallings Stars’, ‘Dark Galaxy’, and the etching ‘Reverse Galaxy’ to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "title": "Ellen Gallagher",
    "body": "One of the most widely acclaimed artists to have emerged since the mid-1990s, Ellen Gallagher (b. 1965) comes from Irish and African-American stock. Her work draws on a broad spectrum of influences that spans the writings of Gertrude Stein and Herman Melville, the art of Sol LeWitt and Agnes Martin, the musical and theatrical tradition of blackface minstrelsy, the free jazz of Sun Ra, the Black Power movement and the visual tropes of advertising targeted at African-Americans. From these diverse sources she has created a painterly vocabulary that reflects her complex engagement with history, identity, story-telling, society, race and gender by embedding politically-charged symbols in delicate Minimalist forms.\n\n'Paper Cup', included in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, is a prime example of Gallagher's mature work. Its grid structures, comprised of small pieces of writing paper in multiple rows, might initially call to mind the handwriting exercises undertaken by children at school. In fact, the shapes can be seen to resemble the protuberant lips stereotypically assigned to American blackface minstrels as a crude racial identifier. The artist addresses the same themes in 'Untitled', a large-format painting also included in ARTIST ROOMS.",

    "body": "Gilbert (b. 1943) and George (b.1942) have been important figures in the international art world since 1970. Working as a pair and presenting themselves as ‘living sculpture’, incorporating themselves and their lives into their art, they set out to provoke their viewers, to make them think and question conventions and taboos.\n\nIn the key 1970 \"magazine sculpture\" included in ARTIST ROOMS they smile up at the viewer with cut-out letters pinned to their chests reading ‘George the Cunt’ and 'Gilbert the Shit’. From the beginning their work emphasised the artists’ own image, their place as misfits in society and their concept of ‘art for all’.\n\nBy the end of the decade they had moved beyond the enclosed spaces of their house, their drinking and their life as artists to explore the world and the people around them in the East End of London. The ‘Dirty Words’ series focused on graffiti photographed in the streets of the city. Gilbert and George were now not just taking art to the people but incorporating the people into the art. At the same time they declared their purpose was to find and accept all that was good and bad in themselves.\n\nThe big, multi-part, brightly coloured works from the 1980s in ARTIST ROOMS come from this period of huge energy and change, when Gilbert and George were also developing new and specifically modern techniques of photography and printing to make their art appropriate to the people with and for whom it was made. Throughout the decade they also exhibited their work around the world in a highly modern way, with masses of huge brightly coloured images made from glazed panels arranged and hung according to their precise instructions.",

His work, which draws from and comments on popular culture, technology, the mass media and a wide range of current events, continues to be highly influential worldwide.\n\nThe works in ARTIST ROOMS - 'Four Self-Portraits 05.3.81' - exemplify his lifelong preoccupation with portraiture, its conventions and possibilities as well as his use of darkroom printing and image-making techniques. From 1968 Hamilton engaged in a project to publish four volumes of Polaroid portraits of himself, taken by artist friends and acquaintances: a composite self-portrait created over many years with the help of many other artists. In 1980 and '81 the artist took about 20 Polaroids of himself standing behind a sheet of clear glass.He then added thick acrylic colour to some of the photographs. The project was never completed but nearly ten years later Hamilton decided to make twelve of these into self-portraits by scanning and retouching them in his Quantel Paintbox. They were then scanned to make 10\" x 8\" transparencies. These were then further enlarged into Cibachrome prints which were then mounted on canvas. Hamilton was not only one of the first artists to use manipulated photography and to recognise its interactive potential, but he was also one of the first artists to make work with the aid of computers.",

    "title": "Douglas Gordon",
    "body": "Douglas Gordon (b. 1966) is a Scottish artist, working with photographs, film, text and installations. He explores the nature of perception and memory and force us to reassess how we fabricate meaning from our experience of the world.\n\nHe uses defamiliarising techniques to encourage us to reconsider the means by which he or she processes visual information. He manipulates time and space in video – by slowing down or speeding up film, or by using several screens to create an immersive environment.\n\nThe artist’s preoccupation with memory (also apparent in the work 'List of Names' (1990–present), which itemises the name of every person Gordon can remember having met) is apparent in the acclaimed video projection '24 Hour Psycho' (1993). This work consists of a projection of Alfred Hitchcock’s thriller slowed down so that it stretches over the course of a single day. 'Play Dead; Real Time' (2003) (included in the ARTIST ROOMS collection) presents two videos on large screens, each showing the performance of a series of memorised actions (what we might in another context call ‘tricks’) by a trained circus elephant.\n\nCommanded by the voice of an unseen authority, the elephant (suffering from an illness during the filming) struggles to fulfil the demands placed upon it. The sequence is presented from a variety of perspectives, providing an eloquent, moving insight into the nature of memory, action and mortality.\n\nDouglas Gordon was the 1996 winner of the Turner Prize, and in 1997 represented Britain at the Venice Biennale. Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to acknowledge the artist's donation of four works, 'Divided Self 1 & 2' (1996), 'Film Noir (Fly)' (1995), 'I am the curator of my own misery' (2010) and 'Looking down with his black black ee' (2008) to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

It compiled video footage of airplane hijackings from the 1930s to the present day, a visual history of a terrorist tactic which would be employed to its most shocking effect four years later, during the September 11 attacks on New York.\n\nThe images of hijackings are interspersed with clips referencing the Cold War and other historical conflicts, while a voiceover reads quotations from Don DeLillo’s novels 'White Noise' and 'Mao II'. By recycling film from news broadcasts, Hollywood movies, animated films and commercials, Grimonprez introduced a video aesthetic familiar to the generation that had grown up with television. The means by which he edits and juxtaposes the diverse sources reminds us that history is shaped by those who tell it, less a series of facts than an aggregation of events subject to selective interpretation.",

In the 1960s he was already recognised as one of Britain’s foremost concrete poets, but went on to extend his ideas beyond the printed page to become objects in the material world. His work, often collaborative and in a wide variety of media including stone carvings, constructions and neon lighting, is a unique blend of art and poetry. The monumental installation in ARTIST ROOMS, 'Sailing Dinghy', consists of a boat, used by Hamilton Finlay himself, accompanied by a poem which evokes its movement. Much of Hamilton Finlay's early poetry concerns sailing and fishing boats, and this elegant, affectionate piece encapsulates the artist’s passion for ships and the sea.\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to recognise the artist's generous donation of works to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "title": "Damien Hirst",
    "body": "Damien Hirst (b. 1965) is the most prominent artist to have emerged from the British art scene in the 1990s. His role as artist and curator has proved fundamental in the development of the group that became internationally known as the 'YBAs' (Young British Artists).\n\nHirst is fascinated by the age to which he belongs, and he uses the preoccupations and passions of the time to confront the age-old fears of his audience about the fragility of life, of death and decay. These are preoccupations constant throughout history but Hirst presents them in a specifically contemporary, pseudo-scientific way. Where Joseph Beuys present himself as the scientist/shaman of the past, Hirst presents his vision in the bright light of modernism and the sanitised world of science. Where Warhol's studio was called 'The Factory', Hirst's studio management company is called 'Science'. He lures us with the protective wrapping and doubtful promises of the pharmacy, the isolating reliquary-like glass cases of the museums and the window displays of jewellery shops whose contents promise to be forever. But his viewers know there is a downside. Some of his glass cases contain cigarette butts as well as pills and in others there are animals 'preserved' in formaldehyde.\n\nWe know the human race has both protected and damaged itself through science. We have cut ourselves off from nature by science and we have tried to control nature by science. Science has killed millions and we are afraid it might destroy the planet. Yet science has produced many benefits (not least these works) and made the world a better place for many while making it worse for others. Is science a fairy tale? Hirst suggests that the artist and the scientist and the curator may be the ringmasters but the audience have the final say. We are the conscience of our time.",

    "body": "Although from a younger generation than Lawrence Weiner, Jenny Holzer's use of language has made her one of the pioneers of conceptual art. Working on both a small and, more recently, large scale, her use of new technologies and subtle understanding of architectural and even landscape spaces shows her to be one of the most most significant, uncompromising and truth-seeking artists of our time.\n\nEveryone can access the meaning of text but not everyone knows that it can be a sculptural experience. Born in 1950, Holzer's early texts - short, pithy, printed statements - appeared on walls, the sides of telephone booths, as mail shots, on T-shirts and baseball caps. She began using Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs) in public spaces and in the 1990s began to uses Xenon projections which can reach onto buildings from a distance. Over the years, her writings have become a social and psychological portrait of our time. Her projects have included the American Pavilion at the 44th Venice Biennale, where she won the main prize.\n\nHolzer worked with ARTIST ROOMS to create a group of works which shows some of the recurring themes she has worked on, such as violence, power, war, sex and money. She also made available two paintings from her 'PROTECT PROTECT' series in which she presents formerly classified material relating to the Iraq War containing battle plans and the testimonies of soldiers and detainees. The towering 'BLUE PURPLE TILT' consists of seven double-sided vertical LED displays and is programmed with a selection of messages from several of Holzer's early text series.\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to recognise the artist's generous donation of works to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

Although best-known for large-scale portraits, painted in his distinctive, stylised manner, Katz has also consistently made small paintings primarily as studies, which function as independent pieces and which can be considered as a distinct body of work.\n\n ",

    "title": "Jeff Koons",
    "body": "Jeff Koons (b. 1955) grew up in the environment of his father's furniture and interior decoration business in York, Pennsylvania. It seems to have been a loving, innocent, unsophisticated environment where his inspirations were the Beatles, Salvador Dali and art classes on Saturday mornings. His paintings were hung on the walls of the showroom. In 1977 he moved to New York where he worked on the reception desk, then the membership desk at the Museum of Modern Art, before selling mutual funds and commodities on Wall Street - both things seemingly appropriate for his work as an artist.\n\nAt first through his use of everyday items such as vacuum cleaners, Koons reflects on the power of consumer industry and aesthetics as a basis for art. In 'New Hoover Convertibles' he preserves a banal household object as a perfect timeless commodity in a glass case in perpetuity, like a sacred relic, its function rendered obsolete. The idea of protected perfection is also at the heart of 'Encased', from a series of basketball works where the balls achieve constant equilibrium by being suspended in liquid. These glass case works link Warhol's soup cans, electric chairs and coke bottles to Hirst's animals in vitrines. They are both lifeless and eternal, symbols of order and chaos, full of human aspirations and fears about the fragility of our existence.\n\nPursuing his interests in the basic dreams and desires of human society from the cradle to the grave and in the psychological, economic and social structures of the historic past Koons, like Warhol and others, takes objects from the 'real' world and renders them iconic by changing their size and turning them into High Art. In Koons's case he rescues them from their lowly status as kitsch (by inference a form of Arte Povera) and sanctifies them by turning them into art of the avant-garde.\n\nPresented as the exact opposite of the uninflected banality sought by the abstract artists of the 1970s, Koons takes banality very seriously and invests it with all possible glory. His means of production, first in the studio and then through the demands he imposes on fabricators, is famously perfectionist. 'Winter Bears' was first shown in Koons’ landmark exhibition 'Banality'. The carved wooden figures derive from popular figurines, blown up to mammoth proportions to create a sculpture that is at once familiar yet grotesque.\n\nKoons’ fascination with debased kitsch and Baroque styles is also found in 'Mound of Flowers', made according to the traditions of Murano glass, and the 'Bourgeois Bust', a marble sculpture which depicts the artist and his then-wife, Ilona, in a traditional style unchanged since the Roman Republic. This portrait bust is part of a larger body of work in which Koons and Illona starred in their own erotic romance, documented through a series of sculpture and photographic works. The billboard 'Made in Heaven' and the 'Art Magazine Ads' employ the standard methods of the advertising industry and were made to publicise the project.",

    "body": "A key figure in European post-war culture Anselm Kiefer derives his art from his awareness of history, theology, mythology, literature and philosophy and the extraordinary ability to work with all kinds of materials from lead to concrete, from straw to human hair and sunflower seeds.\n\nBorn in 1945, Kiefer set out in his early work to try to understand Germany’s recent history, even in the 1960s still a somewhat taboo subject. He was interested in the work of Joseph Beuys, and discussed his work with him, but was not one of his students. Early images included Kiefer setting out on his journey, walking through a forest holding a burning branch. Later works drew on German military history, Wagnerian mythology and Nazi architecture in an attempt to grapple with the possibility of pursuing creativity in the light of past catastrophic human suffering.\n\nKiefer’s technique of layering paint and lead, straw, earth and other materials onto his canvases gives a visceral presence to his preoccupations with decay and regeneration. He makes literal use of those materials to make visual and descriptive or symbolic points. ARTIST ROOMS includes major works from across the artist’s career. 'Palette' (1981) expands on the recurring theme in his work that painting is equal to a burning which will cleanse the countryside and cauterize the wound inflicted by Nazism. Here painting is symbolised by a palette suspended above a smouldering abyss by a rope which is alight in several places, suggesting the tightrope walked by every artist, and especially by artists in Germany. The painting 'Urd, Werdande, Skuld' refers to the Norns (fates) of Germanic mythology whose names are Past, Present and Future and who sit by the well at the foot of the Yggdrasil (the world ash), spinning or weaving the fate of men. They are an invisible presence in the grandiose vaulted emptiness of one of the many unbuilt monuments to the delusion of the Third Reich.\n\nAfter the reunification of Germany, Kiefer moved to Barjac in the south of France, and later to Paris, creating large studio complexes in each place. His exploration of revolution in generation, and in particular the women of the French revolution, began in Germany and expanded to include the role of women in antiquity. His also studied ancient belief systems such as the Kabbala and travelled widely, to South America, India, China and Australia. His painting took on global and cosmic perspectives, and he worked on an ever larger scale. He became increasingly interested in natural cycles, and in Robert Fludd’s theories about the lives of plants, the microcosm and the macrocosm, and his suggestion that for every plant there exists a correlated star. 'Man under a Pyramid' (1996) reflects the artist’s interest in exploring his mind and body through meditation and in relating it to the stars and the cosmos through the form of the pyramid.\n\n'Cette obscure clarté qui tombe des étoiles' (The dark light that falls from the stars) is a favourite line from 'Le Cid' by Corneille which came to mind when Kiefer began to work with the sunflowers native to his new home in the south of France. ‘There was an obvious parallel', he said, 'with the black seeds on the flower and the night and the stars. The seeds were the stars. When I stuck them on a white canvas they became inverted stars, black on white like a negative.’ Kiefer’s preoccupation with the stars has led to paintings of star maps.\n\nThe monumental installation 'Palm Sunday' (2006) is one of Kiefer's most powerful installations. Addressing the duality of triumph and betrayal, the fallen palm and framed ossuary of plants and leaves which surrounds the wall suggest both death and resurrection.",

They leap to conclusions which logic cannot reach.' LeWitt's early sculptural works use geometric shapes, seriality and pre-determined structures to break from the personal, heroic and emotive gestures that dominated Abstract Expressionism. Taking the form of a set of instructions which are then produced by assistants, the artist’s numerous 'Wall Drawings' employ systems which enable line and colour to exist as independent entities from their creator. 'Wall Drawing #1136' (2004) is a late example in which vibrantly coloured straight and non-straight lines are painted directly onto the four walls of a gallery space to create a three-dimensional environment which surrounds the viewer.",

    "title": "Jannis Kounellis",
    "body": "Jannis Kounellis (1936 - 2017) was born in the Greek port city of Piraeus, but lived in Rome after 1956. His first exhibition in Rome in 1960 was titled 'Kounellis Alphabet' and combined living and inert materials. He used steel instead of canvas for his paintings and applied to it fire, earth, coal, wool, plants, and live and dead animals.\n\nIn the later 1960s Kounellis became associated with the Italian Arte Povera movement which tried to free art from the conventions of that time and by using simple ordinary materials attempted to bring it closer to everyday life. The 1969 work in which he turned a gallery into a stable for twelve horses brought him international fame, and the grandeur which which he invests \"poor\" objects has become characteristic of his exhibitions, as has the tug between past and present, industrial and agrarian life, religious and non-religious society; things which seem antithetical to one another but exist in conjunction though not always in comfort.\n\nKounellis' work integrates many different art forms - painting, sculpture, music, theatre and poetry. The sculpture and works on paper in the ARTIST ROOMS collection span Kounellis' career and represent the diversity of his work. The collection includes two major sculptures involving church bells, now out of use and out of their element, referencing the role of the church in society but also the part played by bells in the life of human beings and their communities.\n\n'Coal sculpture with glass wall' brings together the darkness of coal and the brightness of light, both altered by heat and the movements of the earth over specific aeons of time, ranging from millions of years to form the coal, to the thousands of years during which people made glass bead curtains in Greece, Egypt and other hot places. As coal was used to heat and power the cold industrial north, so the work contains within it the physical and economic history of the planet.\n\nThe largest installation in this collection is that in which an army of steel girders seems to be marching across a floor covered with oriental rugs, which could be a mosque or a domestic setting. The iron suggests one active, masculine, industrial or pugilistic approach whereas the carpets suggests a softer, more contemplative, peaceful one. Perhaps there are two sides to human beings in general, which are not a matter of gender but of temperament.",

    "body": "The German sculptor Joseph Beuys (1921-1986) is recognised as one of the most influential figures of the second half of the twentieth century. Artist, political and social activist (he was a founder of the Green Party), scientist and educator, Beuys’s philosophy proposed the healing power and social function of art, especially in the context of the period following World War Two but also as something in which all people can participate and benefit. His works are based on what he called ‘constellations of ideas’ and can incorporate any kind of material or object to represent these ideas according to their inherent properties or purposes.\n\nFrom the 1950s onwards many of his works were made from or allude to a distinctive group of materials, in particular, felt, fat and copper for their insulating, conductive and protective, transmitting and transforming properties. Beuys produced a vast body of work that bridges art and science and includes what he called actions, lectures, drawing, print-making, sculpture and installation. His complex interlocking themes cover biology, archaeology, geology, anthropology, zoology, politics, mythology, history, religion, intuition, medicine, the sciences and communication, amongst others.\n\nBeuys’s own image and life story is an essential part of his work and he appears as a shamanistic presence throughout his oeuvre. The group of drawings belonging to ARTIST ROOMS is one of the most important collections of Beuys' works in the world. The ARTIST ROOMS collection of sculpture brings together important subjects from the 1960s such as 'Fat Chair' with later works from the 1980s, culminating with the important 'Scala Napoletana' which dates from the period of Beuys’s final work, 'Palazzo Regale'. It was made in Naples, only a few months before his death, and relates to the same theme of the shaman’s death and his communication with the beyond.",

    "title": "Agnes Martin",
    "body": "The career of Agnes Martin (1912 - 2004) spanned nearly five decades during which she came to be regarded as one of America's foremost abstract painters. From the same generation as the Abstract Expressionists, although identifying more with Barnett Newman, Mark Rothko and Ad Reinhardt than the action painters, in the early 1960s she lived at Coenties Slip, New York, along with the younger generation of Ellsworth Kelly, Jack Youngerman and Robert Indiana.\n\nMartin's search for a kind of transcendent beauty led her to paint her first grid paintings at this time and she subsequently destroyed most of her earlier work. The grid allowed her to create paintings which were without intellectual content or reference. Eschewing perceptual space or brushwork composition or texture they were self-descriptive and self-referential in a way that clearly represented a new beginning for painting at that time. However, by 1967 the pressures of success and illness led her to leave New York for New Mexico and temporarily to stop painting all together, only contacting her gallery some seven years later. Martin practised meditation and was much influenced by her interest in Eastern philosophy.\n\nThe paintings from Martin’s later career held in ARTIST ROOMS exemplify her exquisite handling of paint. The delicate colours appear to project beyond the picture plane to engage all the senses. 'Happy Holiday' and 'Faraway Love' come from a sequence of paintings from the late 1990s in which the artist used titles to evoke states of euphoria, contentment and memories of past happiness.\n\nWe are indebted to the American Fund, courtesy of Milly and Arne Glimcher, for their donation of 'Untitled #5' to the Tate Gallery for the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "title": "Mario Merz",
    "body": "A major figure in the Arte Povera movement, the Italian artist Mario Merz (1925 - 2003) combined a fascination with the material and metaphorical qualities of natural objects with ideas regarding infinity and repetition.\n\nMuch of his work was based around the Fibonacci sequence, a formula often used to express mathematical sequence in natural structures. In around 1966, the artist began using neon, making works in which the lights penetrated ordinary objects such as raincoats and umbrellas. 'Che Fare?' – meaning ‘what is to be done?’ and deriving from a pamphlet published by Lenin – is one of the artist’s earliest neon objects. Merz later explained that the idea for the work came from watching children repeating the words as they played and noted that the work ‘represents awareness of the centrality of a simple question’. 'Lingotto', which also uses beeswax, was made in the same year that Merz began exhibiting with other artists associated with Arte Povera and is a strong example of the artist’s use of humble matter so characteristic of the group. The ‘poor’ materials (bundles of brushwood topped by a box of beeswax) that create the imposing sculpture are set against the title of the work which means ‘ingot’, and its allusion to luxury, precious metals.",

    "body": "Richard Long (b. 1945) was among the foremost of a new generation of British sculptors to emerge in the 1960s who extended the possibilities of sculpture beyond the confines of the studio and gave it meaningful existence as part of the place, time and substance of which it is made. He has said \"my work is not illusory or conceptual. It is about real stones, real time, real actions. I use the world as I find it.\"\n\nAnother revolutionary aspect of his work is the relationship between movement and time. Long’s work is rooted in his deep affinity with nature, developed during his walks in Britain, Nepal, Africa, Mexico, Bolivia, India, Morocco, Japan and many other places around the world. While travelling he may set himself specific tasks, or he may make something suggested by the landscape, such as walking a straight line for a predetermined distance, following the source of a river, or picking up and then dropping stones at certain intervals along his route. But Long never makes permanent changes to the landscapes he passes through, rather he adjusts nature’s placement of rocks or wood to form simple, geometric shapes appropriate to the place.\n\n'Somerset Willow Line' (1980) and 'Cut Slate Ellipse' (2005), both included in ARTIST ROOMS, are two key examples of works made specifically for an indoor architectural setting. He documents his journeys with photographs, maps, wall drawings and printed texts which evoke his responses to the landscapes through which he passes.\n\nLong has said that his aim is to explore \"relationships between time, distance, geography and measurement\", and elsewhere that whereas his photographs and text works feed the imagination, his sculptures feed the senses. However \"both inside and outside works are made in the same spirit. The urban and rural worlds are mutually dependent and have equal significance in my work.\" He uses nature with respect and freedom and \"makes works for the land not against it\".",

Pursuing a freelance career in 1964, he soon acquired a reputation as a provocative street photographer and was to become the most prominent artist to emerge from the influential Provoke movement (1968–70), connected with the experimental photography magazine of the same name. The socially engaged Provoke magazine sought to free photography from tradition, presenting a radical new black and white style characterised as grainy and blurred. An admirer of Jack Kerouac's On the Road, much of Moriyama’s work is concerned with photographic journeying and the chance encounter. He describes his process as follows: ‘I simply go outside and walk… I walk, I encounter, I shoot. It may look like I’m just pointing the camera at what’s in front of me. But I’m trying to photograph what people see, but don’t notice – something that’s mysterious and unknown in everyday life.’ Moriyama has been the subject of numerous major exhibitions in Japan, Europe and the United States since the 1970s and he won the prestigious Hasselblad award in 2019.",

    "body": "Born to German parents living in Australia, now long resident in London, Ron Mueck (b. 1958) has become internationally famous for his unnervingly lifelike sculptures of the human figure, executed with extraordinary technical precision. Mueck's sculpture takes its psychological power from the directness with which it addresses universal experiences such as birth, life and death.\n\nThe three works in ARTIST ROOMS represent the scope of Mueck’s approach, from the uneasy intimacy of 'Spooning Couple', the vulnerability of the giant 'Wild Man', and enigmatic half-smile in 'Mask III'. He first became widely known for his sculpture 'Dead Dad', shown in the 'Sensation' exhibition in 1997. His use of widely different scales would not be considered strange within the conventions of painting but has a particularly strong effect in 3D. This manipulation of size, so central to our emotional reactions to the sculptures, is part of the artist’s relationship with his subject and the meaning of the work.",

    "title": "Charles Ray",
    "body": "Charles Ray (b. 1953) has worked with film, photography, sculpture and installations to explore the notion of representation and to conflate reality with the surreal. Based in Los Angeles, his early practice can be viewed in the context of the Body Art movement that emerged in the West Coast during the late 1960s and early 1970s. In the iconic two-part photographic work 'Plank Piece' the artist documented the appropriation of his own body as a sculptural component. The static quality of the photographs belies the performative nature of the work in which the artist’s body is literally doubled-up into a graphic form, creating an image that is at once humorous and unsettling.",

    "title": "Bruce Nauman",
    "body": "Since the mid-1960s the American sculptor Bruce Nauman (b. 1941) has been one of the most highly respected and influential figures in contemporary art. He is noted for his toughness, his refusal to compromise, his exploratory way of working and his search for self-knowledge. His work, and is leavened by a liberal dose of humour, combines bodily consciousness, physical activity, mental activity, linguistic manipulation and a background in mathematics. It also focuses on perception, spatial relationships, human psychology and issues of life and death. Early in his career Nauman abandoned painting in favour of sculpture expressed through performance, installation, film, video, photography and neon (amongst other activities).\n\nHis restless intellect seems to drive a continual desire to question, experiment and re-invent. ARTIST ROOMS covers nearly thirty years and a wide range of his work in different media. These include 'Enforced Perspective: Allegory and Symbolism 1975' which is constructed from 36 rhomboid steel blocks four inches high and fourteen across arranged in eight groups of which six are made from five blocks and two of three. Nauman made a number of installations in which the various materials and sizes mean the perspective of the work is manipulated in different ways.\n\nThe artist and the spectator's relationship with walls and floors is a frequent subject of his work in the 1970s. Nauman made 'Changing Light Corridor with Rooms' in 1971, which consists of a long narrow corridor with a room on each side, of which one is rectangular and one triangular. The corridor is dark, but lights in the rooms are programmed to go on and off, raising the viewer's consciousness of his physical and mental response to this unsettling situation.\n\nNauman was one of the earliest users of neon tubing to display written statements, puns and anagrams. In 1972, for his retrospective at the LA County Museum of Art, he proposed an outdoor neon which would encircle the outer walls of the building based on the adjacent paleontological and archaeological site called the La Brea Tar Pits. The wording of the flashing message included the name of the place and the anagram Art Tips and Rat Spit taken from the words Tar Pits. The outdoor work did not happen, but in the same year he made the unique multi-coloured version now in ARTIST ROOMS.",

    "title": "Don McCullin",
    "body": "Don McCullin (b. 1935) is one of the world's greatest photojournalists, famous around the world for his work in conflict zones from Northern Ireland to Vietnam.\n\nMcCullin learned his trade in the Royal Air Force in the 1950s, during which time he was deployed in the Suez, Kenya and Cyprus. He first came to prominence with the publication of a series of pictures of a London street gang in the 'Observer' newspaper in 1959, which took him on as a photojournalist. In the ensuing years he published acclaimed images of the construction of the Berlin Wall, protests against the Cuban Missile Crisis and the 1964 Congo crisis (for which he disguised himself as a mercenary). The following year, McCullin made the first of his fifteen trips to Vietnam. His bravery and commitment became legendary, and in the course of his career he suffered serious injury while on assignment in El Salvador and Cambodia. In the latter case, his life was saved by his camera when it intercepted a Khmer Rouge bullet.\n\nThe photographs in ARTIST ROOMS exemplify McCullin's ability to bring his audience almost unbearably close to the experience of people living under conditions that we can barely imagine. His work documents the second part of a century riven by war, mass emigration, famine and political upheaval on a vast scale, focusing on the particular and in each case unique plight of individual men, women and children.\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to acknowledge the artist's generosity in donating 'Shell Shocked US Marine, The Battle of Hue 1968', printed 2013, to the ARTIST ROOMS collection. A further 38 works are in the process of entering the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "body": "At the heart of the paintings of Robert Ryman (b. 1930) is a concern with the materiality of painting. Since the 1950s he has reduced his work to a simple equation of canvas (or other support) plus white or off-white paint. Ryman’s concentration on the components of painting set him apart from his contemporaries. During the 1960s he integrated aspects of seriality associated with Minimalism and Conceptualism and he is frequently assessed in terms of these movements. 'Untitled (Study for Brussels)' was made at the time of the artist’s solo exhibition at the Palais des Beaux-Arts Brussels in 1974. The ten panels exemplify Ryman’s non-objective style in which the choice of white, support and visible fixings offer the possibility for unlimited experimentation. The artist has said ‘Sometimes I use warm white because I wanted to have a warm absorbing light. At other times I’ve used colder white … it has to do with light – softness, hardness, reflection and movement – all these things.’",

    "title": "Gerhard Richter",
    "body": "Gerhard Richter was born in 1932 in Dresden, which after World War II became part of the German Democratic Republic. He left the DDR shortly before the Berlin Wall went up in 1962 and settled in Düsseldorf. He has since become one of the world’s most successful and influential artists.\n\nIn the mid-1960s Düsseldorf was one of the most stimulating places to be in the world. The arts clashed with the economic miracle. The Fluxus movement, including Joseph Beuys, was staging its events. Richter had his first one-man show with Alfred Schmela in 1964, Beuys exhibited there in 1965. The future gallery owner Konrad Fischer, together with Richter and others, created the short-lived movement Capitalist Realism. Richter exhibited several of his early works based on photographs in his 1964 exhibition. Although he felt that art needed to be shaken up at this time, he never considered giving up painting.\n\nRichter began his ongoing investigation into the process of painting at this time, and as can be seen from his book entitled 'The Daily Practice of Painting' (1992), it has sustained him ever since. His work generally demands a long period of gestation. The most flamboyant-seeming abstract marks are precisely applied. There always has to be a good reason for what and how he paints.\n\nHe identified three broad areas of activity in painting: figurative, constructive and abstract. But the categories overlap and the artist may also use early works as a reservoir of ideas to be developed later. During the 1960s and into the 1970s Richter’s work was primarily figurative but the realist tendency is always balanced by the care the artist takes to distance it from naturalism, by using photographs. He paints his images in shades of grey, or in black and white, and blurs and simplifies them by brushing over the wet paint. This arbitrary intervention also disassociates the work from the personal responses of the artist and makes it seem more abstract. In portraits such as ARTIST ROOMS' 'Brigid Polk' (1971) and 'Gilbert, George' (1975), there is a similar blurring effect. In '48 Portraits' (1971/1998) realism is tempered by the black and white photo reproduction source from an encyclopaedia which makes these images seem both primitive and iconic, and perhaps closer to propaganda than portraiture. Just as Richter has always maintained that in portraiture he prefers to paint from photographs as a means of keeping his personal reactions out of the picture, when dealing with an abstract situation Richter always maintains a connection with the world of reality outside the picture. His coloured mirrors bring the outside world into them, though their dark colours present a world of shadows. Since the 1970s Richter has made many purely abstract paintings which concentrate on the often dramatic reality of colour, brushstroke and texture, but these can sometimes reveal contrary existences beneath the final surface.\n\nARTIST ROOMS covers all aspects of the artist’s complex practice and includes unique works in many different media from the sculpture 'Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo' (1971) to the more recent glass sculpture '11 Scheiben (11 Panes)' (2004).",

    "body": "Robert Therrien (b. 1947) presents a world of the unexpected filled with objects which are both familiar and strange. It can seem a fairytale place of deceptively childish charm and logic where ideas can literally be translated into reality. Inanimate things can become strikingly animated, soft and light become hard and heavy and size seems out of control.\n\nDuring the 1980s the artist began to make objects with simple, recognisable shapes such as jugs, coffins and doors, transforming them through a variety of media including copper, wood and bronze. This developed his engagement with the notion of the found object, addressed most explicitly in his found brick paper drawings. His work with changing scale began in the early 1990s. Some objects he uses are found, some are made by and for the artist. His use of domestic images might suggest an interest in the spatial world of still-life but his interest in the human body’s interaction with space is more connected to architecture. Therrien’s images and the objects he selects expose the hidden drama of the unnoticed, invisible, physical and mental relationships which exist in the world of human beings, between human beings and between the objects they create to help them live their lives.\n\nARTIST ROOMS comprises a group of exemplary works which express both the ambition and surrealism of Therrien’s practice, including a room-sized version of table and chairs from 2003 and a recent, striking installation, 'Red Room' (2007).\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to acknowledge the artist's generosity in donating two works - 'No Title (Beard Cart)' and 'No Title (Stacked Plates)' - to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "body": "The American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe (1946 - 1989) pushed the boundaries of his medium with both his subject matter and innovative techniques. Originally trained as a sculptor, his understanding of the human body in relation to the light which reveals it means that his distinctive style possesses a classical quality that captures the stillness and the sensual qualities of the body in space.\n\nHis work was considered controversial for its frequently explicit subject matter, but Mapplethorpe triumphed over legal campaigns testing the right to individual freedom of expression. His work therefore also holds a significant place in the history of artistic struggle to depict the world as it is. The group of photographs in ARTIST ROOMS, probably the best collection in the world after that held by the Guggenheim Museum, includes studies of flowers and portraits of many of the most influential artists, writers and musicians of the period, including Andy Warhol, Truman Capote and Patti Smith, alongside iconic self-portraits such as the one featured above.\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to acknowledge the generosity of the Robert Mapplethorpe Foundation, New York, both in the donation of numerous works to the ARTIST ROOMS collection (click for images, above) and in its continued support.",

    "body": "For over fifty years the American artist Cy Twombly (1928 - 2011) explored the natural world, literature, poetry, classical history and mythology through poetic, gestural painting and abstract sculptures. His lyrical use of letters and words as formal elements in abstract compositions blurred the relationship between calligraphy, drawing and painting and emphasised the action of mark-making.\n\nBorn in Lexington, Viriginia Twombly moved to Rome in 1957, and later to Gaeta south of the city, where he spent a large portion of his life. In the early 1950s he attended Black Mountain College in North Carolina where he met Franz Kline, Robert Motherwell and John Cage. In the late 50s he worked in New York where he met Jasper Johns and shared a studio with Robert Rauschenberg.\n\n'Souvenir de l’Ile des Saintes' (1979), one of a small archipelago of islands in the French Antibes of Guadeloupe where a famous sea battle took place in 1782 between the French and the British, is the suite of eight works on paper in ARTIST ROOMS and represents the artist’s first experiments with watercolour. The vibrant colours found in the first sheet are transformed on subsequent pages into cloud-like washes, conveying memory as transient, sensual delight.",

    "body": "Bill Viola (b. 1951) was among the first artists to explore the possibilities of film and video in a fine-art context. Long respected as a groundbreaking artist, his depictions of raw human emotion have achieved popular acclaim in recent years.\n\nViola has continued to utilise progressively more advanced equipment, but the technology which enables us to focus on his highly staged moving images remains hidden. Influenced by both Western and Eastern art history and spiritual practices, Viola’s work frequently evokes mystical or religious experience. 'Catherine’s Room', based on a fourteenth-century predella by Andrea di Bartolo, presents scenes from the life of St Catherine across a sequence of five screens, using contrasts of light and dark to dramatic effect. 'Four Hands' concentrates on actions made by a pair of disembodied hands reminiscent of Indian ‘mudras’, the symbolic gestures of Buddhist and Hindu religious iconography. Both works are characteristic of Viola's more intimate works as opposed to his monumental projects dealing with the universal themes of birth, death and regeneration.",

    "title": "Lawrence Weiner",
    "body": "Lawrence Weiner (1942-2021) was among the pioneers of conceptual art, and one of the most influential artists at work in the world. A self-taught artist born in the Bronx, in New York City, Wiener considered himself to be a sculptor, contending that sculpture is an idea which can be realised in any given material. This principle derived from the artist's determination to make art as widely available as possible: a sentence or idea is not confined to a gallery, but can be widely disseminated and adopted by its audience.\n\nWeiner said of his childhood that 'I grew up in a city where I read the walls; I still read the walls. I love to put work of mine out on the walls and let people read it. Some will remember it and then somebody else comes along and puts something else over it. It becomes archaeology rather than history.'\n\nHe typically used language, words which have no physical form in themselves, to create the relationship between the art work and the person encountering it. Weiner's 'statements' can take many forms: as text mounted on the walls in gallery or public spaces, as books and posters, as sculptural objects, as audio or video recordings, as the lyrics to songs, even as tattoos.\n\nARTIST ROOMS brings together a cycle of wall text works dating from 1988. This series consists of ten statements, each suggesting a physical action or invoking the manipulation of an object or material. Each of them expresses a very physical engagement with the material world: ‘CRUSHED BETWEEN COBBLESTONES’, 'ROUGHLY RIPPED APART', 'TUCKED IN AT THE CORNERS’ or ‘DAUBED WITH MUCK AND MIRE’. The visitor is asked to question the relationship between an idea, which has no physical form and can be expressed through words, and the actions or states being described by those words. Does the artwork consist in the idea to do something, or in doing it?",

    "title": "Ed Ruscha",
    "body": "Born in 1937, Ed Ruscha’s exploration of language and American West Coast culture centred on Hollywood has made him one of the pre-eminent artists of his generation. Since the early 1960s he has channelled his fascination with words and the act of communication into books, printmaking, drawing and painting. His work has much in common with Pop Art, but while Ruscha’s carefully planned paintings and drawings draw on popular references and mass media, his playful use of irony, paradox and absurdist juxtapositions have set him firmly apart from any movement.\n\nARTIST ROOMS holds a remarkable survey of Ruscha’s work dating between 1962 and 2005 including an important group of drawings and several key paintings that explore the various series that the artist has made since the 1960s. Early works such as 'HONK' (1962) and 'DANCE?' (1973) involve single, pithy words in strong typographic format, while the catch-phrase drawings of the mid-1970s such as 'I PLEAD INSANITY BECAUSE I'M JUST CRAZY ABOUT THAT LITTLE GIRL' (1976) invoke vernacular language against single fields of colour.\n\nA more brooding atmosphere emerges in the later series, 'The End', which illustrates the words with imagery that recalls film and traditions of ancient printing. The artist’s enjoyment of the contradictory and illogical is at play in the mountain paintings, a sequence of works begun in the late 1990s in which sublime alpine landscapes form the backdrop for banal statements, often used in advertising, as found in 'Pay Nothing Until April' (2003).\n\nTate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to acknowledge the generosity of the artist in donating the magnificent painting 'The Music from the Balconies' to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.",

    "body": "August Sander (1876 - 1964) is one of the finest photographers of the twentieth century. He pioneered a realist, almost scientific approach based on observation which made him one of the heroes of modern photography. In 1910 Sander moved to Cologne and produced his first large group of photographs, which he would later include in the encyclopaedic project 'People of the 20th Century' that he created in the mid-1920s and continued to work on up until the 1950s.\n\nSander’s approach to the project was highly methodical and based on an almost sociological analysis of Weimar Germany. He divided his portraits into seven main groups: The Farmer, The Skilled Tradesman, The Woman, Classes and Professions, The Artists, The City and The Last People. His survey encompasses those who wear Nazi uniforms as well as those they persecuted, including his son Erich, jailed for his political beliefs. Sander also includes the disabled, the sick and, in a few cases, the dead. Most subjects wear work clothes, often uniforms, and are occasionally depicted holding the tools of their trade. Names were usually excluded, even when the sitters were well-known figures in German society.\n\nAll through his portfolios of portraits, August Sander sought to present a truthful picture of the age by photographing representatives of all classes and backgrounds. He was hugely influential upon a new generation of European and American photographers who emerged in the wake of the Second World War.",

    "title": "Francesca Woodman",
    "body": "American photographer Francesca Woodman (1958 - 1981) has eighteen rare vintage black and white photographs in ARTIST ROOMS, from a collection once owned by the artist’s boyfriend. Woodman’s photographs exhibit many influences, from symbolism and surrealism to fashion photography and Baroque painting. They have a timeless quality that is ethereal and unique. The artist began taking photographs at the age of thirteen and though she was only twenty two when she took her own life, she left behind a substantial body of work.\n\nFrancesca Woodman’s photographs explore issues of gender and self, looking at the representation of the body in relation to its surroundings. She puts herself in the frame most often, although these are not conventional self-portraits as she is either partially hidden, or concealed by slow exposures that blur her moving figure into a ghostly presence. This underlying vulnerability is further emphasised by the small and intimate format of the photographs.\n\nWe often see her in otherwise deserted interior spaces, where her body seems to merge with its surroundings, covered by sections of peeling wallpaper, half hidden behind the flat plane of a door, or crouching over a mirror. Found objects and suggestive props are carefully placed to create unsettling, surreal or claustrophobic scenarios. Her photographs are produced in thematic series’, relating to specific props, places or situations.\n\nWoodman was exposed to the symbolic work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977-78 and his influence can clearly be seen in many photographic series’, such as 'Eel Series, Roma' (1977-78) and 'Angel Series, Roma' (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs suggest extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject.",

    "title": "Andy Warhol",
    "body": "The most famous proponent of Pop Art, Andy Warhol (1928-1987) took images from the popular press, advertising and other ubiquitous images such as dollar bills and signs, and fixed them forever in the public imagination through his enduring fascination with celebrity and mortality. Nearly thirty years after his death he is still one of the most influential artists of our time. His presence has fed back into the culture whence fit came and this circular energy continues to inspire creativity around the world.\n\nBorn in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, the youngest child of devout Byzantine Catholic immigrants from Slovakia, Warhol's childhood was dogged by illness, causing him to spend much time drawing. His father worked in construction and paid for his education while his mother, an embroiderer, gave him drawing lessons and his first camera, and later lived near him in New York.\n\nWarhol moved there in 1949 to pursue a career in commercial art. He found a job with 'Glamour' magazine and rapidly became one of the most successful commercial artists of the 1950s, working for 'Harper's Bazaar', NBC, Tiffany and 'Vogue', among others. His first New York exhibition, 'Fifteen Drawings based on the Writings of Truman Capote', was held in 1952.\n\nBy the end of the decade Warhol was concentrating mainly on painting and drawing inspired by media techniques and popular subject matter. And by the early '60s he was using the silkscreen technique which became the basis of his working practice. He selected ordinary images and objects of everyday American life as his subjects, taking them plain and unchanged from their media sources: Coca-Cola bottles, dollar bills, Heinz soup cans, electric chairs, pop stars, newspaper photographs of plane and car crashes. Talking about the soup cans. he said he wanted to make paintings of 'nothing', which parallels the ethos of Arte Povera and related movements in Europe.\n\nWarhol's focus on the singular image and its potential and actual replication, together with his elimination as far as possible of the traces of the hand or emotions of the artist, also echoed in the photographic and silkscreen processes he used and his designation of his studio as The Factory, implying big business, large-scale production, and a Warhol brand.\n\nPerhaps Warhol's Catholic background may have given him an understanding of the importance of the heraldic language in Christianity and of the nature of Christian belief. He worked at his local church all his life and made important series on the subject of 'The Last Supper'.\n\nOn top of his painting, drawing and printmaking Warhol was constantly at work on film, photography, writing, publishing and making a detailed visual and/or sound record of his daily life and conversations, creating a total image of himself and his work.\n\nThe ARTIST ROOMS collection includes a staggering array of important works, representing all phases of the artist's career. Among the highlights is a unique collection of 50 early works on paper as well as the iconic multiple 'Skulls' (1976) and the multiple 'Self-portriat Strangulation' (1978). The collection includes a unique room of late diptychs as well as the celebrated four part 'Camouflage' (1986), the central exhibit in the Andy Warhol retrospective at the National Gallery of Scotland in 2007. ARTIST ROOMS also includes a group of spectacular stitched photographs and a series of Polaroid self-portraits. The collection is complemented by 126 Warhol posters from all periods of the artist's career, including his films.\n\nThe deconstruction and reconstruction of art around the world at this time also caused many artists to make themselves part of their work in ways different from abstract expressionism, amongst them Yves Klein, Joseph Beuys, Gilbert and George and Richard Long.\n\nMaking an iconic image by removing it from its context and preserving it complete and whole ensures it doesn't 'describe' a piece of our time actually 'is' our time. Althought he sources from which it sprang can age and die, Warhol's images don't look faded or dated and what looked like glamour then looks like glamour today.",
