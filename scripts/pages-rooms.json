His immediately recognisable style draws on American and European painting traditions and is influenced by the work of Matisse and Monet. At the same time, the crisp stylised surfaces of the paintings have an affinity with pop art.\n\nThis must-see exhibition features works selected from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, providing viewers with the opportunity to see Katz’s trademark portraits and some lesser known, large scale landscapes, here in Carlisle for the first time."

Behind Warhol’s seemingly facetious quip was the serious belief that art would become increasingly mechanised.\n\nThe exhibition examined the work of Andy Warhol and Eduardo Paolozzi, showing how they captured images from photography and advertisements. Warhol traced his images while Paolozzi used collage, until they both turned to screenprinting in the early 1960s to transform photographs into prints. The exhibition included rarely seen drawings by Warhol from the 1950s, as well as his famous multi-coloured prints of Marilyn Monroe and a group of recently acquired ‘stitched’ photographs. Works by Paolozzi included some of his early proto-Pop collages from the early 1950s and his kaleidoscopically-coloured prints from the 60s and 70s."

The selection of work on display at The Atkinson includes iconic self-portraits, studies of ﬂowers, portraits of many of the most inﬂuential artists and celebrities of the New York cultural scene in the 1980s. These include the artist’s close friend and muse Patti Smith and fellow artists Andy Warhol and David Hockney.\n\nThe exhibition also includes work from the late 1970s and early ’80s when Mapplethorpe was documenting the New York S&M scene. The resulting photographs are shocking for their content and remarkable for their technical and formal mastery.\n\nIn 1986 Mapplethorpe was diagnosed with AIDS. Despite his illness, he accelerated his creative efforts and continued to broaden the scope of his photographic inquiry. The Whitney Museum of American Art mounted his ﬁrst major American museum retrospective in 1988, one year before his death in 1989. His vast, provocative, and powerful body of work has established him as one of the most important artists of the twentieth century."

Adopting this principle, The McManus have worked with the artist to present his texts in different forms. One cycle of wall texts will be presented in Scots – translated by distinguished author James Robertson. Texts will also be installed within museum displays around the building – the text resonating alongside Dundee’s rich collections of natural history, archaeology, world cultures, industrial machinery and the spectacular architecture of The McManus itself.\n\nThe exhibition at The McManus will bring together a cycle of wall texts from the ARTIST ROOMS collection with a later wall piece and a selection of posters, drawings, artist books and ephemera from the Tate and The University of Dundee.\n\nThe McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum offers a fascinating insight into the city’s culture and history with more than eight galleries. The venue celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2017 and is home to the city’s fine art, applied art and whaling industry collections. In 2018 the McManus presents its first ARTIST ROOMS exhibition, in the same year that the city celebrates the opening of the V&A Museum of Design, Dundee."

Moriyama explained how he used photography to convey his subjective experience: ‘By taking photo after photo, I come closer to [...] the fragmentary nature of the world and my own personal sense of time.’\n\nIn Farewell Photography the energy of the modern city is expressed through images which provide an impression rather than a faithful representation of the urban environment. Moriyama’s approach included re-photographing images, working without a viewfinder and embracing printing errors. The resulting photographs are blurred, scratched and grainy. By pushing the medium to the limits of legibility Moriyama attempted to go ‘to the end of photography’.\n\nThe photographs in the slide projection were shot on the Japanese island of Hokkaido. Moriyama compulsively photographed this landscape during a time of personal crisis, working through 250 rolls of film. He kept these undeveloped images for 30 years before printing them. In contrast to the claustrophobic energy of Moriyama’s images of cities, the open spaces of Hokkaido suggest feelings of loneliness and isolation.\n\nMoriyama has defined the photograph as ‘a fossil of light and time’. Memory draws together a range of images taken by Moriyama over many decades. The series underscores photography’s ability to preserve but also add depth and resonance to memories, and highlights how Moriyama re-uses and re-thinks his own work."

The exhibition is one of three major photography exhibitions opening at National Museum Cardiff this autumn. The season brings together the work of four of the most influential photographers in the history of the medium, August Sander, Martin Parr, and Bernd and Hilla Becher.\n\nSander sought an honest portrayal of German society by photographing people of all ages and backgrounds; from farmers, policemen and politicians to bricklayers, secretaries and artists. The result is an ambitious body of work that captures, above all, the humanity of his subjects. His portraits celebrate the importance of the individual.\n\nThe exhibition is drawn from a major collection of over 170 modern prints, produced from the original plates by August Sander’s grandson, Gerd Sander, and placed on long loan to ARTIST ROOMS.\n\nARTIST ROOMS is a touring collection of over 1,600 works of modern and contemporary art. The collection is displayed across the UK in solo exhibitions that showcase the work of 42 major international artists.\n\nThe ARTIST ROOMS touring programme is delivered by the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate in a partnership with Ferens Art Gallery through to 2020, supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, by Art Fund and by the National Lottery through Creative Scotland."

He began his career creating commercial graphics for a Los Angeles advertising agency in the 1960s. His subsequent work often references advertising, both in themes and technique. How words, sounds and images relate to each other is an ongoing fascination.\n\nUsing eye-catching type, Ruscha makes us expect a straightforward advertising slogan. Instead, he creates strange or contradictory images. He has said, ‘I’ve always had a deep respect for things that are odd, for things that cannot be explained. Explanations seem to me to sort of finish things off’.\n\nThis display reflects the range of Ruscha’s practice, including paintings, prints and photographic books. It includes examples of his use of unusual substances. DANCE? 1973 was made using coffee, egg white and mustard. Ruscha often draws inspiration from his adopted hometown of Los Angeles. Its architecture and imagery feature in much of his work. Full of irony and humour, his works can also be interpreted as commentaries on American society.\n\nEd Ruscha was born in 1937 in Omaha, Nebraska, USA. He lives and works in Los Angeles.\n\nCurated by Kerryn Greenberg and Valentina Ravaglia\n\nThis display draws from ARTIST ROOMS, a touring collection of over 1,600 works of modern and contemporary art by 42 major artists. The collection is displayed across the UK through a touring programme, supported by Arts Council England, Art Fund and Creative Scotland. The ARTIST ROOMS collection is owned jointly by Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland and was established through The d’Offay Donation in 2008, with the assistance of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, Art Fund and the Scottish and British Governments.\n\nThe ARTIST ROOMS Gallery opened in the Blavatnik Building on 17 June 2016 with an exhibition of Louise Bourgeois, followed by Bruce Nauman in 2017 and Jenny Holzer in 2018."

Her photographs speak to her agency in being both the subject and creator of the work. Drawing from the significant holding of Diane Arbus within ARTIST ROOMS, the exhibition included the limited-edition portfolio, A Box of Ten Photographs (1969-1971), which was selected by Arbus herself and as such, can be seen as representing her creative expression and how she wished to be seen as a photographer. Finally a series of portraits of Robert Mapplethorpe explored the photographer’s varying personas, as expressed for the camera, and poignantly document his declining health as a result of having contracted AIDS. The exhibition occured during the 30-year anniversary of his death."

Creating often monumentally sized paintings using his signature hand-painted dots, Lichtenstein’s style mimicked the Ben-Day dot aesthetics of comic books and commercial newsprint, becoming synonymous with the pervasive and accelerating effects of popular mass culture at the time. Sometimes incorporating text, his paintings and prints use irony and cliché to reflect on the contemporary conditions of his day, from obsessions with youth and beauty, to the socio-political context in which he found himself working.\n\nARTIST ROOMS Roy Lichtenstein has been developed in partnership with Tate and National Galleries Scotland, and provides a rare opportunity to see such a substantial collection of Lichtenstein’s work in the north of England. This solo exhibition showcases a key body of his work which has been placed on long loan to the ARTIST ROOMS collection by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation."

Her art takes many forms, including stone benches, projections, signs, posters, paintings, plaques and textiles. Words are central to her work, whether pasted on a wall, flickering from an electronic sign, carved in granite or stitched in wool.\n\nEarly in her career, Holzer delivered messages on posters and T-shirts so they would be seen in everyday places rather than in museums and galleries. Her work addresses the information overload and multiple perspectives we read daily. Eye-catching or quiet and lyrical, Holzer's art invites us to read and interpret for ourselves.\n\nHer texts can be forceful and apparently simple, but may contradict one another. They are not necessarily straightforward expressions of the artist’s views. Truisms, Holzer’s first text series, is a survey of belief.\n\nHolzer has described her aims:\n\nI wanted a lot simultaneously: to leave art outside for the public, to be a painter of mysterious yet ordered works, to be explicit but not didactic, to find the right subjects, to transform spaces, to disorient and transfix people, to offer up beauty, to be funny and never lie."

The normal functions of furniture and crockery become impossible. We can’t use them, but we can explore them. They provide an opportunity for a childlike perspective on the adult world.\n\nRobert Therrien was born in 1947 in Chicago. The table and chairs he chose to scale-up, made by the Gunlocke Company, are typical of a mid-twentieth-century American interior. This was a time of economic growth in the United States. Domestic items such as tables, chairs and plates were produced in their thousands every day. Therrien’s sculptures show us details we might overlook in such common objects.\n\nThe works have various artistic and literary forerunners. Surrealist artists in the first half of the twentieth century made familiar things appear strange. Many tried to produce ‘uncanny’ experiences, defined by psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud as ‘that class of frightening which leads back to what is … long familiar.’ Shifts in scale are central to Jonathan Swift’s Gulliver’s Travels (1726) and Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland (1865). In these books a change of size is a playful way of exploring political and philosophical questions."

In these later prints, he deliberately hides his trademark imagery under abstract patterns\n\nLichtenstein was a US pop artist, inspired by mass-produced images. He came to prominence with paintings featuring ‘Ben-Day dots’. These mechanically printed spots were used to colour newspaper and magazine pictures. His work presents the paradox of machine-printed imagery that has actually been carefully made by hand.\n\nThis room brings together five works from Lichtenstein’s Reflections print series. To make them he combined different printing techniques with collage. Each features one of his earlier paintings partly obscured under bands of colour. He came up with the idea when he was trying to photograph another artist’s work through glass. Lichtenstein said: ‘It portrays a painting under glass. It is framed and the glass is preventing you from seeing the painting. Of course, the reflections are just an excuse to make an abstract work, with the cartoon image being supposedly partly hidden by the reflections.’\n\nPop artists quoted from, and reused, imagery found in popular culture. The Reflections series can be seen as Lichtenstein’s wry comment on these techniques, as he reuses and re-presents his own past work."

Throughout his career, Nauman has investigated who we are, physically and mentally, using the human body and the space it inhabits. His own body became an important tool and reference point, whether performing in videos, or being cast to form part of a sculpture. Using self-imposed limitations and systems, he exposes the body’s vulnerability, as well as the human potential for violence and our need to communicate.\n\nWords are both the subject and the form of many of Nauman’s works. Through thought-provoking wordplay, his neon pieces and works on paper cast new light on everyday phrases. Sound and the human voice are also significant aspects of his artistic approach, be it using his own voice or employing actors to perform unsettling and humorous scenarios. Disrupting the traditionally quiet space of the gallery, Nauman wants the experience of his work to be: ‘like getting hit in the face with a baseball bat. Or better, like getting hit in the back of the neck. You never see it coming; it just knocks you down.’"

It is known as ARTISTROOMS and focuses on individual rooms devoted to particular artists.\n\nOne of the foremost German artists who came to prominence in the 1960s, Baselitz has been concerned with ways to invest renewed significance in the human figure. Born just before the Second World War, he grew up in Communist East Germany and studied in academies on both sides of Berlin before settling in the West. In choosing to engage with a painterly and figurative tradition, he rejected the prevalent trend towards abstraction, but was also careful to avoid an imitative realism tainted by its association with totalitarian propaganda.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Baselitz began to depict what he called ‘new types’ of lone male figures, including series of ‘Rebels’ and ‘Heroes’. Vigorously painted in ways that echo early expressionism, these figures assumed a monumental stature, yet Baselitz wanted to discourage easy judgements about what they represented. In 1969 he took the remarkable step of turning his figures upside-down, unsettling the viewer and allowing the paintings to be seen as almost abstract works.\n\nThroughout his career, Baselitz has absorbed and confronted aspects of German history, capturing uncertainties and anxieties that permeate European culture more widely.\n\nGeorg Baselitz was born in 1938 as Hans-Georg Kern. He took the name Baselitz from his birthplace of Grossbaselitz, a village in Saxony, eastern Germany. He lives and works in Basel, Switzerland, at lake Ammersee, Germany, and in Imperia, Italy.\n\nCurated by Matthew Gale."

He is perhaps best known for his work which examines the viewer’s relationship to scale, and which often also allude to modest household items.\n\n\n\nTherrien’s works explore the space between reality and the world of dreams, drawing the viewer into the realm of fables and fairytales, childhood games and unfinished narratives. The immediacy, accessibility and playful relationship with childhood in Therrien’s work offer huge potential for The Exchange to build upon its track record for engaging young people with contemporary art.\n\n"

Many of the works shown here were part of an exhibition called Zeitgeist held in 1982 at the Martin-Gropius Bau, Berlin. In a section entitled ‘Workshop’ Beuys installed a huge mound of clay – a raw material formed from the earth – and surrounded it with sculptures as well as furniture, tools and other items taken from his studio.\n\nAfter the exhibition, Beuys made casts of some of the elements to create 'Lightning with Stag in its Glare'. In this installation, his animal sculptures – composed from the ramshackle detritus of industrial civilization – are endowed with mythic significance. The bolt of lightning itself was a bronze cast from a section of the clay mound, while the stag was cast in aluminium as if illuminated by a sudden flash of light. Maggot-like primordial creatures were fashioned by embedding tools such as spanners and screwdrivers in scoops of clay. Made towards the end of the artist’s life, the installation addresses themes of finality and death, but also ideas of regeneration through the transformative power of natural energies."

She developed her artistic practice while at Rhode Island School of Design, during her year studying in Rome, and later in New York.\n\nWoodman’s archive includes more than 800 black-and-white photographic prints, many of which are self-portraits. Each image is a carefully choreographed performance for the camera. Woodman regularly staged her work in empty studio spaces and abandoned buildings. She used furniture, wallpaper, shadows and her body to conceal as much as she revealed. Her work invites us to consider how we see ourselves and how we are perceived by others.

You cannot see me from where I look at myself.’\n\nFrancesca Woodman, Untitled, from Eel Series, Venice, Italy 1978. ARTIST ROOMS Tate and National Galleries of Scotland. © Woodman Family Foundation / Artist’s Rights Society (ARS), New York and DACS, London."

Its programme reaches audiences across the UK and is developed through local partnerships.\n\nBorn in Paris in 1911, Bourgeois settled in New York in 1938, where she remained for the rest of her life, continuing to make art until her death at the age of 98. Bourgeois’s art was closely bound up with her life, and she used art as a way to make sense of her experiences. Her sculpture, drawing, and writing are characterised by emotional honesty, as she retold the memories and stories that shaped her life. Using different forms and materials including marble, bronze, latex, and fabric, Bourgeois made work that is personal, provocative, vulnerable, and raw; work that reaches out to us with a powerful immediacy more than a decade after her death.\n\nThis exhibition focuses on works produced during the last 20 years of her life, a period of extraordinary creativity, during which Bourgeois re-examined many of her lifelong concerns to create a body of powerful new work exploring identity, gender, childhood, family and memory. Her use of textiles, including age-worn garments from her household and personal history, give her late sculptures a sense of intimacy and mortality.\n\nBourgeois is perhaps best-known for her large-scale spider sculptures including Maman 1999, created for the opening of Tate Modern in 2000. A symbol and representation of motherhood, and her own mother in particular, who was a weaver and the manager of the family’s antique tapestry restoration business, the spider is a recurring motif throughout Bourgeois’ work. For the first time on this current tour of ARTIST ROOMS Louise Bourgeois, visitors will be able to see one of these monumental spider sculptures for themselves when Spider 1994 occupies one of Grundy’s side galleries. This is one of several important loans from The Easton Foundation in the exhibition, and will provide a mesmerising addition to what is already a world-class display of one of the 20th century’s most important artists.\n\nARTIST ROOMS Louise Bourgeois at Grundy Art Gallery will be supported by a public programme of talks, workshops and events. Please check Grundy’s website and social media for more information."

Creed has been recognised internationally for his distinctive approach to art – playful, thought-provoking, and deeply ambiguous.\n\nArtist, musician, composer and performer, Creed's multi-disciplinary practice draws on the everyday. He transforms common materials and actions into surprising meditations on existence, choice and perception, and the invisible structures that shape our everyday experience. His art continually overturns our expectations and is characterised by his subversive wit.\n\nCreed’s Work No. 370 Balls, 2004 is set to fill the entire Main Gallery at the Mercer. The vast installation features nearly 1000 balls of different scale, weight and texture. Visitors will also be able to see Creed’s iconic neon Work No. 890: Don’t Worry, 2008 alongside Work No. 1340, 2012, a large-scale wall painting of diagonal stripes.

Arbus gave considerable thought to what this portfolio should be and how it should look, selecting a set of ten images that date from as early as 1963, comprising some of her most iconic portraits, including Identical twins, Roselle, N.J. 1966 and A Jewish giant at home with his parents in the Bronx, N.Y. 1970. For Arbus, the ten images represented who she was as an artist and how she saw her work in the world, a legacy that became more solidified with her death in 1971."

Bourgeois was the first women to be given a sculpture retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1982, and the first artist to have an exhibition at Tate Modern in 2000.  \n \nBourgeois’ art was closely bound up with her life, and she used artmaking as a way of making sense of her experiences. Her sculpture, drawing and writing are characterised by an unflinching emotional honesty, as she continually retold and reworked the memories and stories that shaped her life. With a compelling need to make and re-make, she explored different forms and materials to find the most appropriate means of expressing her ideas and emotions, combining carved marble, cast bronze, wood, latex or stitched and stuffed fabric and found objects."

It brings together a selection of Barlow’s celebrated large-scale sculptures as well as over 30 works on paper made across her sixty-year career.\n\nCutting, sawing, breaking, coiling, folding or covering: Barlow has been fascinated by the experience of handling materials since the late 1960s. Her work is playful and unwieldy, with layered surfaces and contrasting textures, often daubed or wrapped in bright colours. Her structures disobey the rules of gravity, balance and symmetry. They look as if they might collapse or tip over at any moment and challenge our expectations of beauty in sculpture.\n\nObservation and drawing are key to Barlow’s process, but her intention is never simply to record the world around her. Barlow is interested in the act of remembering, and the details that are lost in the process. In her drawings and sculptures, real-world subjects become abstract versions of themselves. Her works seem to resemble houses, stages, awnings, and racks made strange. Barlow’s sculptures often reveal the means of their making, but her choice of materials can be deceptive. Sometimes wooden structures are covered with a thin layer of cement to appear heavier than they are. Colour is added using fabric, tape and construction foam alongside paint and dye.\n\nFor Barlow, ‘the sculptural object is restless and unpredictable in how it can use space. It is not necessarily a comfortable or comforting experience.’ Barlow’s sculptures interrupt and invade the space around them. They direct our movements and attention, encouraging us to look at things in new ways.\n\nPhyllida Barlow was born in 1944 in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK. She lives and works in London."

Beuys’s activities became explicitly politicised in the 1970s. He founded a Free Academy and the more overtly political Organisation for Direct Democracy through Referendum. Later he became involved in the German Green Party.\n\nThe two large installations in this room date from the final years of Beuys’s life, when he returned to working with stone, wood and bronze. Both works address themes of finality and death, but also ideas of regeneration through nature.\n\nIn 1982, Beuys took part in an exhibition in Berlin. He installed a huge mound of clay and surrounded it with sculptures as well as furniture and tools from his studio. Afterwards he made casts of some of the elements to create Lightning with Stag in its Glare 1958-85. The bolt of lightning itself was a bronze cast from a section of the clay mound. The stag was cast in aluminium, as if illuminated by a sudden flash of light.\n\nIn The End of the Twentieth Century 1983-5 blocks of basalt lie scattered on the ground. Basalt is volcanic in origin, and Beuys associated it with the earth’s ancient energy. Into each of the slabs, Beuys bored a conical hole to create a ‘wound’. He then ‘treated’ it by smoothing and lining the hollow with insulating clay and felt, before re-inserting the stone. These filled cavities imply the potential for healing, suggesting the possibility of renewal at the end of a violent and destructive century."

    "body": "ARTIST ROOMS: Andy Warhol shows the sharp critical opinions of an artist known to many primarily as art salesman, purveyor of product and celebrant of capitalism. Supported by Arts Council, Art Fund and Creative Scotland, the exhibition is drawn from ARTIST ROOMS, a collection of international modern and contemporary art owned by National Galleries of Scotland and Tate on behalf of the public. Focusing on themes of death, politics and identity it presents audiences with Warhol’s reading of the American Dream at a time when the country is under scrutiny following the 2016 US Presidential election.\n\nIn 1968 Andy Warhol was pronounced dead; shot by feminist author, activist and member of his entourage, Valerie Solanas. He was taken to hospital, received an open-heart massage and was revived. Warhol explored his encounter with death through his art and in the photograph of his scarred torso by Richard Avedon. This visual examination of his death is a recurring motif in the exhibition where Avedon’s photograph of Warhol as a scarred Frankenstein's monster will be displayed alongside the pale, empty-eyed Warhol in Self-Portrait with Skull (1978) and Self Portrait Strangulation (1978). Warhol's experimentation with his own appearance as a symbol of his work is shown in a series of Self-Portraits. His repetitive self-image a foreshadowing for the current selfie culture.\n\nThe Electric Chairs series (1971) presents viewers with a symbol of death once more. The series, taken from the 1953 photo agency image of the empty death chamber of Communist spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, was used by Warhol during a period of growing political protest in America against the death penalty. It is the artist's engagement with the state and politics which is also the foreground to the Art and Illustration series (created in the 1980s). From this collection paratrooper boots, maps of US missile bases and symbols of nuclear power is displayed as silkscreen prints in the hand-drawn illustrative style of Warhol's early advertising work.\n\nControversial objects that symbolise 20th century America were also depicted in colourful and large scale format by Warhol. Of these works Dollar Sign (1981), Camouflage (1986) and Gun (1981) are presented here at the Whitworth, raising further questions around Warhol's opinion of America."

And the way that he expressed these ideas most readily was in his drawings.\n\nThis exhibition will bring together, for the first time, the extraordinary group of over 110 drawings by Beuys held in the ARTIST ROOMS collection. The drawings cover the whole of the artist’s career from 1945 to the end of his life, reflecting his encyclopaedic interest in nature, science, philosophy, mythology, society, politics and religion. This is the one of the largest and most important collections outside Germany by this key figure of post war art.\n\nARTIST ROOMS Joseph Beuys - A Language of Drawing is part of Edinburgh Art Festival."

Her highly executed artworks ‘redescribe’ the photograph, translating the image from one surface to another. She chooses subjects that lack a central point of reference, allowing her to explore the relationship between limitless space and the flat plane of the paper.\n\nThis exhibition includes unique graphite, charcoal and eraser drawings such as Untitled (Desert-Galaxy) 1974 and Web #1 1999, as well as prints which employ intaglio, lithographic and relief processes.\n\nThis year Dunoon Burgh Hall is commemorating the 150th anniversary of their impressive Victorian building, which was saved by the local community and restored into a cultural hub for the West of Scotland. Following a major refurbishment in 2017, the building relaunched with an inaugural exhibition of ARTIST ROOMS Andy Warhol.

She asks herself: ‘How do you cope – within and without – when all these views are present, sometimes clamouring, sometimes fighting, sometimes murderous?’ Eye-catching and attention-grabbing, Holzer’s art invites us to read and interpret her messages for ourselves.\n\nEarly in her career, Holzer delivered her messages on posters and T-shirts so they would be seen in everyday contexts rather than in museums and galleries. LED signage, used for advertising and financial markets displays, offered another vehicle for her text-based projects. The scrolling electronic text echoes the way people encounter fragments of text in city streets.\n\nBLUE PURPLE TILT shares the room with Joseph Beuys’s installation Lightning with Stag in its Glare. A large bronze sculpture, cast from a mount of earth, is suspended from a metal beam above our heads. It represents a lightning bolt striking the ground. Smaller sculptures symbolise animals surrounding it. The stag of the title is an ironing board balanced on logs, cast in shiny aluminium. This is a stark, petrified environment. Beuys was a performance artist, educator and environmentalist. He was concerned about modern society inclining towards ecological disaster."

North Hertfordshire Museum is the final venue of this exhibition tour, and the first in the south of the UK."

    "body": "Agnes Martin was a key figure in the male-dominated field of abstract art in the USA. In the 1950s and 1960s her work was often associated with abstract expressionism and minimalism. However, Martin’s methods were different. In her meticulous, hand-painted artworks, ordered geometry and imperfection co-existed.\n\nThe paintings in this room consist of horizontal bands of colour, divided by delicate pencil lines. The bands initially appear uniform, but on closer inspection, faint brushstrokes and pools of paint emerge. These marks give the artworks a hand-made feel, undermining the rigid geometry of the composition. As Martin said, ‘the work is about perfection as we are aware of it in our minds but... the paintings are very far from being perfect – completely removed in fact – even as we ourselves are.'\n\nMartin’s work was influenced by Zen Buddhism and Chinese Tao philosophy. Her paintings explore the inner emotional world and the human desire for peace and serenity. She considered art to be a transcendent experience. She explained, ‘Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not just in the eye. It is in the mind. It is our positive response to life’."

    "body": "Ed Ruscha’s exploration of language and American West Coast culture centred on Hollywood has made him one of the pre-eminent artists of his generation.\n\nSince the early 1960s he has channelled his fascination with words and the act of communication into books, print-making, photography, drawing and painting. Ruscha has held a long fascination with the urban landscape around Los Angeles, exploring the grids of boulevards and avenues that order the city in drawings. His interest in language can be seen to derive in part from the signage and billboards that articulate these highways.\n\nHis work has much in common with Pop Art, but while Ruscha’s carefully planned paintings and drawings draw on popular references and mass media, his playful use of irony, paradox and absurdist juxtapositions have set him firmly apart from any movement.\n\nARTIST ROOMS holds a remarkable survey of Ruscha’s work dating between the early 1960s and 2010, including an important group of drawings and several key paintings that explore the various series that the artist has made since the 1960s. Early works such as Honk 1962 and Dance? 1973 depict single, pithy words in strong typographic format, while the catch-phrase drawings of the mid 1970s such as I plead insanity because I’m just crazy about that little girl 1976 invoke vernacular language against single fields of colour. A more brooding atmosphere emerges in the later series, The End, which illustrates the words with imagery that recalls fading film credits. Works in this series include The Final End 1992 and THE END #40 2003.\n\nThe artist’s enjoyment of the contradictory and illogical is at play in the mountain paintings, a sequence of works begun in the late 1990s in which sublime alpine landscapes form the backdrop for banal statements, as found in Pay Nothing Until April 2003.\n\nARTIST ROOMS also contains a number of works from Ruscha's various photographic series. The Rooftop Series, produced by the artist in 1961, comprises four photographs taken from the top of the Carson-Roberts Advertising Agency building in West Hollywood (Residential; Rooftop; Leggett's; Hancock). The series Thirtyfour Parking Lots in Los Angeles was originally produced as a book in 1967, with forty-eight pages encompassing thirty-one photographs depicting thirty-four parking lots. Ruscha reprinted these photographs in 1999, a set of which belongs to the ARTIST ROOMS collection. Examples include Sears, Roebuck & Co., Bellingham & Hamlin, North Hollywood; Good Year Tires, 6610 Laurel Canyon, North Hollywood and Pierce College, Woodland Hills. Nine photographs of empty Los Angeles swimming pools make up the series Nine Swimming Pools and a Broken Glass, which were produced as a book in 1968, and later printed as individual photographic prints (Pool #1, Pool #2, Pool #3, Pool #4, Pool #5, Pool #6, Pool #7, Pool #8, Pool #9). All these series record the urban infrastructure of Los Angeles and its environs with a deadpan approach."

A political and social activist and educator, Beuys believed in the healing power and social function of art. He saw creativity as central to all aspects of human existence, declaring that ‘everyone is an artist’.\n\nThis exhibition marks an important return to the city by Joseph Beuys, who last displayed his work here in 1983. This ARTIST ROOMS Joseph Beuys exhibition will introduce his ground-breaking sculptures, iconic persona and ‘constellation of ideas’ to a new generation.\n\nThis major exhibition brings together sculpture and drawings from the 1950s onwards, drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, as well as the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate. These works show the strong scientific basis for Beuys’ art and his pioneering use of materials such as felt, fat, wax and copper. At the heart of the exhibition is the sculpture Scala Napoletana (1985), made only a few months before the artist’s death in 1986."

Her use of everyday, often recycled, materials such as plywood, scrim, concrete and polystyrene to create seemingly precarious sculptures and installations that invade the gallery space. Resembling things from the real world – houses, awnings, stages, fences – her sculptures are playful, imperfect and unstable looking, with layered, bulky and textured surfaces. Fascinated by the urban environment, by the familiar and the overlooked, Barlow asks us to look at the world differently.\n\nARTIST ROOMS: Phyllida Barlow is part of Turner Contemporary's summer season ‘Every Day is a New Day’. Our summer season celebrates the importance of art and creativity, its capacity to empower all of us and make positive change. It brings together exhibitions by British sculptor Phyllida Barlow, British-Kenyan painter Michael Armitage with artwork by young people from Kent and Africa, and JMW Turner."

He began his career as a successful commercial artist, working in advertising in the 1950s, but also began to work as an independent ‘fine’ artist. He became a leading figure of American Pop Art, which emerged in New York in the early 1960s. A central concern in his work was the increasing power of the popular media - advertising, film and television - in shaping the way we view the world, and particularly in encouraging the cult of celebrity."

Her work experiments with light, sculpture, photography and installation. It explores ideas of the self, gender, eroticism and consciousness which Chadwick drew from philosophy, science and art history.\n\nThe relationship between viewer, subject and artist is never straightforward for Chadwick. In the early to mid 1980s the artist’s own naked body featured frequently in her work. These pieces express her memory or desires as bodily sensations rather than abstract thoughts. However, the artist’s face is hidden or averted, anonymising her body. The viewer is invited to imagine themselves as the subject, rather than to be an external voyeur.\n\nTowards the end of the 1980s Chadwick moved away from overtly using her body in her work. She began experimenting with visceral materials such as cells, animal and human flesh and bodily fluids. Works from this period dissolve the separation between genders, self and other, while also locating human consciousness firmly within the flesh and substance of the body. Chadwick explains, ‘I didn’t know how I could depict my body without being female. It was at this point that I thought if I use the cells of my body, my interior self, then this would be read as “human”.’\n\nIn 1987, Chadwick became one of the first women artists to be nominated for the Turner Prize. Throughout the 1980s and 90s she taught at various art schools across London. Despite her sudden death at only 42, Chadwick’s prolific body of work and her dedication to her practice and teaching made her a vital influence on the next generation of British artists and beyond.\n\nHelen Chadwick, The Labours VI, 1983-4.\n© Estate of Helen Chadwick"

    "body": "Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay created the poem-objects in this room between the 1960s and 1990s. They focus on maritime themes like boats, fishing and seafaring. The sea was a recurring source of inspiration for Finlay. He was born in The Bahamas and lived for a brief but formative time on Rousay, one of the Scottish Orkney Islands. Even when he moved to the countryside near Edinburgh he was never far from a body of water - such as the ponds in his celebrated garden, Little Sparta, in Dunsyre.\n\nFinlay began his career publishing plays, short stories and poems in the mid-1950s. His early works were important contributions to the development of concrete poetry, a form of visual poetry where the arrangement of words and letters is as significant as their meaning. Finlay published his first collection of concrete poems in 1963, and at the end of the 1960s he began making sculptures. The works on display here illustrate these two practices. They generate poetic associations by juxtaposing words, images and materials.\n\nFinlay often collaborated with other artists and craftspeople, who he always credited in his publications and exhibitions. In 1961, he founded the Wild Hawthorn Press. This publishing company produced versions of many of Finlay’s artworks across a range of mediums. Included here are a series of screenprinted ceramic tiles, suggesting ways to experience visual poetry in a domestic environment. The use of tiles in kitchen and bathroom ‘wet rooms’ also playfully chimes with their maritime subject matter."

    "body": "Lichtenstein was a US pop artist, inspired by mass-produced images. He came to prominence with paintings featuring ‘Ben-Day dots’. These mechanically printed spots were used to colour newspaper and magazine pictures. His work presents the paradox of machine-printed imagery that has actually been carefully made by hand.\n\nThis room brings together five works from Lichtenstein’s Reflections print series. To make them he combined different printing techniques with collage. Each features one of his earlier paintings partly obscured under bands of colour. He came up with the idea when he was trying to photograph another artist’s work through glass. Lichtenstein said: ‘It portrays a painting under glass. It is framed and the glass is preventing you from seeing the painting. Of course, the reflections are just an excuse to make an abstract work, with the cartoon image being supposedly partly hidden by the reflections.’\n\nPop artists quoted from, and reused, imagery found in popular culture. The Reflections series can be seen as Lichtenstein’s wry comment on these techniques, as he reuses and re-presents his own past work."

    "body": "People have used language as an expressive art form for millennia, from oral tradition and the spoken word, to illuminated manuscripts and printed publications. This room brings together works produced in the last 50 years in Europe and the USA. They demonstrate different ways of engaging with text and its role as a form of communication.\n\nBy the late 1960s, text was the primary focus of many visual artworks. Artists associated with movements like cubism and Pop Art had long incorporated words found in advertising and mass media. Those interested in concrete poetry (such as Ian Hamilton Finlay) and conceptual art (such as Lawrence Weiner) often made artworks from text alone.\n\nMany of the works in this room respond directly to the proliferation of language and text in the information age, particularly in relation to consumerism. For some artists, text provides a unique way to translate and materialise their ideas. Others reflect on language as an expression of human culture, capable of transmitting ideas, influencing behaviour and memorialising people and events.\n\nSome of these artists focus on the act of writing as a form of making: inscribing, painting, carving, scribbling, typing or embroidering words as personal, meditative and poetic acts. For many, text-based works are a way to actively engage viewers. The reader is invited to imagine what is only described, and to project their own memories and associations onto the artist’s words."

    "body": "In the late 1960s, Lawrence Weiner contributed to the development of conceptual art. The movement proposed that ideas, or concepts, could be experienced as artworks even without a physical form. In 1969, Weiner summarised the principles underlying his art in what he called his ‘Declaration of Intent’:\n\n1. THE ARTIST MAY CONSTRUCT THE WORK\n2. THE WORK MAY BE FABRICATED\n3. THE WORK NEED NOT BE BUILT\nEACH BEING EQUAL AND CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT\nOF THE ARTIST THE DECISION AS TO CONDITION RESTS\nWITH THE RECEIVER UPON THE OCCASION OF RECEIVERSHIP\n\nWeiner viewed himself as a sculptor. He described the medium of his text-based pieces, or ‘statements’, as ‘language + the material referred to’. For Weiner, the active relationship between the work and the audience was key. He said, ‘I hope that the vast majority will read the words for their meaning and that they will place that meaning within the sculptural context of their [own] parameters.’ Through the act of reading and listening, Weiner’s ideas take form in the mind of the viewer. He invites the public to collaborate in the making of his work.\n\nWeiner challenged the notion that art needs a physical form, making works consisting only of written descriptions. Weiner described these works as sculptures that take their form conceptually in the mind of the reader, or ‘receiver’.\n\nWeiner first presented the five statement works in this room in 1991, under the collective title SPHERES OF INFLUENCE. He was inspired to make this series during a trip to Norway, when he became aware that his actions were causing often imperceptible chain reactions in the environment:\n\nI was up in the rocks between Kristiansand and Stavangar and you could... smell the sea more than you could see it. And I realised that there’s a thing called ground water. And whatever I was doing was going through the ground as well... There was something going on that I would not be able to see, which is the eventual flow into the sea or flow into the water system. And that’s what this body of work is about. It’s just on the other side. It really is this: shoot an arrow up in the air, know not where it lands.\n\nLanguage remained at the heart of Weiner’s practice. He used text to make installations that took many forms: the vinyl in this display, artist’s books, music, audio pieces and numerous everyday articles, from clothing to jewellery. From stone to human skin, any surface can become a support for one of his statements. Whatever their medium, these sculptures are activated in the mind of their viewer, allowing the experience of the work to extend beyond the time and place of their encounter."

    "body": "Jannis Kounellis (1936–2017) was born in the Greek port city of Piraeus, but lived and worked in Rome from 1956. His early paintings were inspired by words and graphics found in street signs, which he gradually reduced to letters, numbers and basic symbols arranged over plain backgrounds. Though he soon expanded his practice to include performance and sculpture, he considered himself primarily a painter. Whether making pictures or using materials and objects that share the same space as us as viewers, he aimed to create powerful images, mundane and strange at the same time.\n\nIn the late 1960s Kounellis became a key figure of the Italian arte povera (‘poor art’) movement. Artists associated with arte povera used ordinary materials of both natural and industrial origins and hoped to bring the experience of art closer to everyday life. At the time, Italy was undergoing a period of rapid social change, torn between industrial and agrarian life, tradition and innovation, antiquity and modernity. Kounellis’s works express this clash of values by bringing together contrasting elements such as raw wood and steel beams, or strings of colourful glass hanging next to a mound of black coal.\n\nMany of Kounellis’s installations subtly change the architecture of the gallery, like the stones blocking the passage between two rooms. Some suggest the presence and actions of people: in a work bringing together painting, sculpture and performance, an empty chair lies waiting for a cellist to play a painted musical score. Other works carry strong associations both sensorial and cultural, like those including bells and coffee beans. These objects have a rich history, evoking sounds and smells familiar to many.\n\nDepicted playing are cellists Saskia Wong, Noah Bisseker, and Sergio Serra Lopez during recurring performances next to 'Untitled, 1971'."

    "body": "Agnes Martin was a key figure in the male-dominated field of abstract art in the USA. In the 1950s and 1960s her work was often associated with abstract expressionism and minimalism. However, Martin’s methods were different. In her meticulous, hand-painted artworks, ordered geometry and imperfection co-existed.\n\nThe paintings in this room consist of horizontal bands of colour, divided by delicate pencil lines. The bands initially appear uniform, but on closer inspection, faint brushstrokes and pools of paint emerge. These marks give the artworks a hand-made feel, undermining the rigid geometry of the composition. As Martin said, ‘the work is about perfection as we are aware of it in our minds but... the paintings are very far from being perfect – completely removed in fact – even as we ourselves are.'\n\nMartin’s work was influenced by Zen Buddhism and Chinese Tao philosophy. Her paintings explore the inner emotional world and the human desire for peace and serenity. She considered art to be a transcendent experience. She explained, ‘Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not just in the eye. It is in the mind. It is our positive response to life’."

Weiner defines his medium as ‘language + the material referred to’, emphasising the flexibility of their presentation: these works have no particular physical form in themselves and only exist as language, with the potential to be displayed or otherwise transmitted. So far, Weiner’s statements have taken the form of text inscribed in gallery or public spaces, books and posters, cast or carved objects, spoken dialogue in audio and video works, song lyrics and even tattoos.\n\nInstalled on Levels 2, 3 and 4, this cycle of works from 1988 consists of ten statements, each suggesting a physical action or invoking the manipulation of an object or material. In fact, Weiner regards his statements as sculpture rather than poetry, explaining that ‘they show the relationship of object to object and that is the idea and purpose of a sculpture’."

The exhibition will include 'untitled (to Don Judd, colorist) 1-5' (1987) and a group of four ‘Monument’ to V. Tatlin sculptures, some of the most iconic works of Minimalism. The presentation at Gracefield Art Centre follows on from the successful exhibition of the same works at the Tate Modern, London, as part of the ARTIST ROOMS programme.\n\nGracefield Arts Centre in Dumfries houses a collection of over 400 Scottish paintings, and holds a changing programme of contemporary exhibitions featuring regional, national and international artists. The installation of the Flavin works in this will transform the Gracefield gallery spaces and offer local audiences the first chance to engage with this challenging and fascinating body of work. A range of gallery talks and activities will accompany the exhibition."

    "body": "This exhibition at the Dick Institute, Dumfries, will present a selection of work by the great German painter Gerhard Richter. Regularly cited as the most important painter alive today, Gerhard Richter's work over the past fifty years has sought to examine the very nature of painting as a practice. Addressing subject matter both abstract and representational, often using photography as a starting point, he has mastered an extraordinary variety of painterly techniques, drawing on traditions of photorealism, abstract expressionism and conceptualism in his paintings. He is an artist capable of changing the way that we think about painting, attractive to both admirers of technical expertise in painting and lovers of new ideas.\n\nOpened in 1901, the Dick Institute is one of the most important cultural venues in the south-west of Scotland, featuring the largest museum and galleries in Ayrshire. It also contains reference and lending libraries.\n\n"

    "body": "This ARTIST ROOMS exhibition will reveal how Louise Bourgeois, working in a variety of materials and scales, explores the mystery and beauty of human emotions. Her works explore issues around vulnerability and fear and often draw on her own life experience. Despite the deeply personal references to her own life in her work, as well as to a range of art historical movements, Bourgeois’s unique visual language ultimately reaches beyond both, raising universal questions about life and art. In particular, ideas of womanhood and its various guises including the roles of daughter, wife, mother and lover are explored through a vocabulary of recurring motifs: spiders, spirals, the ‘arch of hysteria’, double forms and entwined fabric bodies.\n\nHighlighting her late work, this outstanding collection of works includes 'Poids' (1993), 'Couple I' (1996) - a stuffed fabric work which Bourgeois made from her own blouses, socks and tights, 'Eyes' (2001–5), and 'Cell XIV (Portrait)' (2000), for which Bourgeois uses three heads of fabric sculpture to represent the multiple and contradictory aspects of a single individual. Among the highlights are two late masterpieces, the cycle of 14 monumental drawings 'A L’Infini' (2008–9) and the artist’s final vitrine, 'Untitled' (2010).\n\nmima will be working closely with its award-winning young friends group to offer a fresh and engaging interpretation of Bourgeois. The exhibition follows the successful showing of Bourgeois at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art."

Her unapologetic approach to photography reveals the complexities of human nature and relationships, making the ordinary extraordinary and the misunderstood familiar.\n\nThe Galleries will explore how her work reflected the social, political and economic changes taking place throughout the United States from the 1950s-70s. Featuring twenty of her most seminal pieces, this exhibition and associated events will highlight how Arbus’ work and photographic technique challenges the viewer to see beyond the shocking to the complexities of each individual subject."

Woodman’s work will be examined in depth, and further explored through working with other public collections.\n\nAmerican photographer Francesca Woodman has eighteen rare vintage black and white photographs in the ARTIST ROOMS display, from a collection once owned by the artist’s boyfriend. Woodman’s body of work, timeless despite the tragically early death of the artist, draws on traditions as varied as symbolism and surrealism, fashion photography and Baroque painting to express the experience of a brilliant young woman. The beauty and immediacy of these ethereal, troubling images is almost unparalleled in late twentieth century photography.\n\nThis presentation is ideally suited to a venue that is committed to presenting 'thought-provoking and challenging art by national and international artists in an environment that is welcoming, engaging, informative and free', and which has reputation for promoting young artists through its Test Bed programme of exhibitions."

Baselitz’s work has a complex relationship to the legacies of German Expressionism and this pairing of exhibitions will give a unique opportunity to explore this aspect of his work. Artists in the collection, the acquisition of which began with the museum's hosting of the groundbreaking exhibition ‘Mid-European Art’ in 1944, include Marc, Kandinsky, Jawlensky and Schmidt-Rottluff. Context to their works is provided by precursors to German Expressionism including Liebermann, Feininger, Kollwitz and Grosz.\n\nAt the heart of the exhibition will be a collaborative learning environment that will have a program of work exploring the performative aspects of Baselitz’s oeuvre and persona."

The collection's preoccupation with themes of birth, new life, fertility and the spiritual and religious offer a perfect counterpoint to Hirst's own evident fascination with human mortality, and offer an example of the innovative curatorial ideas that can be brought to bear within the framework of ARTIST ROOMS.\n\nThe gallery's groundbreaking programme run by young people, 'A Colourful Crowd', was inspired by the exhibition to organise 'Dead Day' at New Art Gallery Walsall, turning the venue into 'a playground of fun, interactive and educational activities'.

The footage showing is simultaneously presented in a front and a rear life-sized projection and on a monitor, with each one depicting the same event from a range of perspectives.\n\nThe viewer is presented with an opportunity to see the animal with a rare intimacy and perspective.

One of the beautiful things about film and video is that it can imbue a sense or sensibility that doesn’t actually physically exist.’"

The show offered visitors to see the work of Ruscha, one of the foremost practitioners of American Pop Art (though his oeuvre cannot be reduced to that movement), in a venue that might conceivably be called the birthplace of Pop. The great British artist Richard Hamilton was a lecturer at Newcastle University when he showed his 'Man, Machine and Motion' installation, one of the founding masterpieces of the movement, at the Hatton in May 1955.\n\nThe Hatton Gallery hosted a series of free talks around the exhibition, part of an outreach programme that includes art workshops for children and teenagers."

A unique selection of late diptychs, as well as the celebrated four-part 'Camouflage' (1986), took pride of place in this presentation.\n\nThe power of Warhol’s work comes from its focus on fundamental human themes – the beauty and glamour of youth and fame, material culture, the passing of time and the presence of death. Employing mass-production techniques, Warhol challenged preconceived notions about the nature of art and erased traditional distinctions between fine art and popular culture.\n\nA selection of spectacular stitched photographs alongside a series of intriguing Polaroid self-portraits highlighted his photographic work. The collection was complemented by 126 Warhol posters from all periods of the artist’s career, including his films and popular imagery from some of Warhol’s most famous works including 'Mao', 'Hamburger' and 'Cow wallpaper' and references to the famous nightclub, Studio 54.\n\nThe exhibition was accompanied by the screening of films including 'My Hustler' (1965), 'Empire' (1964), 'Eat' (1963), 'Sleep' (1963), and 'Beauty No 2' (1965)."

    "body": "Latvian-American artist Vija Celmins is best known for her highly wrought photo-realistic drawings and paintings. She employs found images, in common with many of her contemporaries who emerged from the Los Angeles art scene of the sixties and seventies. Often taking photographs of natural phenomena as a starting point, her work repeatedly reinterprets the same images, initially captured by camera or telescope, to produce intricate portraits of such delicate scenes as deserts, star-filled night skies, oceans and cobwebs. In her prints and drawings she explores traditional printing techniques and the material density of charcoal, graphite and ink.\n\nFor this display the artist selected four unique drawings and related prints from the ARTIST ROOMS collection. In the next room, Vija Celmins selected works on paper by J.M.W. Turner to coincide with the presentation of her own work. Speaking about her selection of works by the British artist, Celmins said:\n\n'In many ways my work is the opposite of Turner. I see his work as impressionistic, full of gesture and colour, open in feeling and luminous with light and activity - storms, and wind, sunsets and sunrises. My work is stilled and my gestures are subdued and hidden. A stroke too active feels wrong to me. The work has no light but the white of the paper and every stroke describes the flat surface and the image together making one solid object.\n\nWe do share, I think, a love for the material we use. Turner leaves the mercurial attributes of watercolour as evidence, and I push the natural density of charcoal, graphite, and mezzotint, so both of us acknowledge the physicality of the material as part of our work. I think we also both like wildness – the wilderness, the impossible image to capture and wrestle onto that small piece of paper. We are also not confessional artists looking to express ourselves but are more observers and describers of the world outside.'\n\n"

He put together groups of four, six or twelve prints of the same image and had them sewn together to form one complete work of art. The thread is left to hang as he did not want to disguise how the work had been made. The posters on display, which span the sixties, seventies and eighties illustrate strong themes within Warhol’s art. He was keenly aware of the power of branding, advertising and marketing, and celebrated the modern commercial world that had provided prosperity for post-war America.\n\nThe Future Ferens, a group of volunteers aged 18 to 25, were closely involved in the organisation of the exhibition and particularly in helping to fulfil one of the key aims of the ARTIST ROOMS programme - making contemporary art more accessible to a young audience. They played a part in selecting the artworks, were involved in the graphic design of the exhibition materials, produced a Warhol timeline as a free hand-out for visitors and even donned fancy dress for the opening."

This exhibition of Sander's works presented a selection from the artist's extraordinary documentary project, 'People of the 20th Century'. Sander sought to catalogue the lives of the entire German people, and in doing so created an unprecedented record of human society.\n\nCurated by August Sander’s grandson, Gerd Sander, the selection of work reflected his understanding both of Sander’s technical genius and the context in which the photographs were produced, knowing many of the stories behind the sitters and their relationship to Sander. The exhibition was presented alongside Leicester’s internationally acclaimed collection of twentieth-century German Expressionist art, and a touring exhibition of George Grosz from the Hayward Gallery. The ARTIST ROOMS exhibition therefore offered a unique opportunity to view Sander’s work alongside great German artists from the same period."

It included some of Warhol’s most iconic pictures, and offered a unique insight into the ‘real’ Andy Warhol from the people who knew him best. Created by art historian Dr Jean Wainwright, 'The Search for Andy Warhol’s Voice' featured a series of audio recordings of Warhol’s family and close friends talking about the artist’s childhood, relationships and approach to his work."

However, the outstanding collection of Mapplethorpe photographs in ARTIST ROOMS allows these ‘controversial’ works to be considered in the context of his entire oeuvre.\n\nIn 1988 Mapplethorpe stated: “I don’t like that particular word ‘shocking’. I’m looking for the unexpected. I’m looking for things I’ve never seen before... I was in a position to take those pictures. I felt an obligation to do them.” Yet Mapplethorpe also photographed more traditional subjects, and the ARTISTS ROOMS collection includes flower studies and portraits of many of the most influential artists, writers and musicians of the period alongside several iconic self portraits – in particular a poignant portrait of Mapplethorpe shortly before his death from an AIDS related illness in 1989.\n\nThis exhibition sought to examine Mappelthorpe's understanding of form and light in the composition of formal portraits, still lifes and figurative works that celebrate the sensual quality of nature and the human body."

Woodman’s photographs exhibit many influences, from symbolism and surrealism to fashion photography and Baroque painting. They have a timeless quality that is ethereal and unique. The artist began taking photographs at the age of thirteen and though she was only twenty two when she took her own life, she left behind a substantial body of work.\n\nFrancesca Woodman’s photographs explore issues of gender and self, looking at the representation of the body in relation to its surroundings. She puts herself in the frame most often, although these are not conventional self-portraits as she is either partially hidden, or concealed by slow exposures that blur her moving figure into a ghostly presence. This underlying vulnerability is further emphasised by the small and intimate format of the photographs.\n\nWe often see her in otherwise deserted interior spaces, where her body seems to merge with its surroundings, covered by sections of peeling wallpaper, half hidden behind the flat plane of a door, or crouching over a mirror. Found objects and suggestive props are carefully placed to create unsettling, surreal or claustrophobic scenarios. Her photographs are produced in thematic series’, relating to specific props, places or situations.\n\nWoodman was exposed to the symbolic work of Max Klinger whilst studying in Rome from 1977-78 and his influence can clearly be seen in many photographic series’, such as 'Eel Series, Roma' (1977-78) and 'Angel Series, Roma' (1977). In combining performance, play and self-exposure, Woodman’s photographs suggest extreme and often disturbing psychological states. In concealing or encrypting her subjects she reminds the viewer that photographs flatten and distort, never offering the whole truth about a subject."

The images on loan explore her meticulous renderings of the surface of the ocean, the vastness of the night sky and her fascination with the microscopic detail of a spider’s web. Works such as 'Drypoint - Ocean Surface' (1983) - so precisely, painstakingly rendered as to be frequently mistaken for a photograph - encourage us to reflect upon the vast, unknowable beauty of the natural world.\n\nTaigh Chearsabhagh Museum & Arts Centre is a partnership between Comann Eachdraidh Uibhist a Tuath and the Uist Art Association, and is located in Lochmaddy, on the shoreline of a marine Special Area of Conservation. The sea and sky dominate in a western Atlantic environment that directly influences the artistic and cultural life of Taigh Chearsabhagh, and is perfectly suited to an exhibition of Vija Celmins' work.\n\nAs part of the exhibition there will be a range of events exploring the artist’s work, drawing particular emphasis on her use of printing techniques and references to astronomy and the night’s sky."

    "body": "Gilbert (b Dolomites, Italy, 1943) and George (b Devon, 1942) met in 1967 as students at St Martin's School of Art in London. By 1969 they were reacting against approaches to sculpture then dominant at St Martin's, which they regarded as elitist and poor at communicating outside an art context. Their strategy was to make themselves into sculpture, so sacrificing their separate identities to art and turning the notion of creativity on its head.\n\nThis exhibition represents several major aspects of the artists’ career from 1969 to 1991. RAMM will be the first Artist Rooms Associate to hold a Gilbert & George exhibition. It continues RAMM’s tradition of creative programming and desire to work with partners to present the best in contemporary art to audiences in Exeter and wider westcountry region."

    "body": "This ARTIST ROOMS display presents Gerhard Richter’s panes of glass and mirrored works, literal reflections on the nature of pictorial representation.\n\nRichter is in many respects a traditional painter, but his work has a strong conceptual core. His paintings are explorations of all the possibilities offered by the medium, whether to reproduce images of reality or to experiment with colours, textures, techniques and gestures. Richter began to use glass in his work in 1967. Like his paintings, these works are concerned with the mechanisms of representation and perception. They are neutral surfaces framing aspects of the world and turning them into pictures. The sculpture '11 Panes' (2004) plays with the material’s ability both to be looked through and to reflect. The transparency of each glass pane, leaning against the wall at a different angle, multiplies reflections as distorted forms that keep shifting as one moves closer or further away from the work. The blurring effect recalls that found in Richter’s figurative paintings. A layer of pigment applied to the back of the glass makes 'Mirror Painting (Grey, 735-2)' (1991) reflect reality as a greyscale picture. It relates directly to Richter’s monochrome grey canvases, one of which can be seen in the minimalism room on Tate Modern's Level 4."

His light sculptures, executed in industrially-produced fluorescent tubes, are among the most instantly recognisable works of post-war contemporary art and a huge influence upon a generation of artists who have sought to work with light and form. This exceptional display features some of Flavin's extensive series of ‘monuments’ dedicated to the Russian constructivist artist Vladimir Tatlin.\n\nThe title of the series refers to Tatlin’s most famous unrealised project, the Monument to the Third International, designed in 1919–20. This 400m double-helix tower was intended to dwarf the Eiffel Tower and stand as the defining symbol of constructivist modernity. Flavin’s monuments are among his most austere works, composed only of cool white fluorescent tubes and avoiding his characteristically exuberant use of colour. He also restricted himself to rectilinear, symmetrical arrangements, without the horizontal and diagonal elements included elsewhere."

The artist uses the existing light fittings, which turn on and off every five seconds, to fill the space with a perpetual cycle of light and darkness. Creed was awarded the 2001 Turner Prize for this work, a decision which at the time provoked much controversy as critics and visitors debated whether such a minimalist installation even constituted art.\n\nCreed’s work challenges received understandings of how we experience art, and indeed what art 'is'. He asks us to question our role as viewers, the artist’s role and the way art is made, presented and perceived. In this installation, the absence of any fixed object on which to focus encourages the visitor to contemplate and reflect upon their own mood, meaning that the audience is as much responsible for the effect of the work as the artist.\n\nThis display was devised by curator Sofia Karamani."

Highlighting her late work, this a first showing of an outstanding collection of works including 'Poids' (1993), 'Couple I' (1996) - a stuffed fabric work which Bourgeois made from her own blouses, socks and tights, 'Eyes' (2001–5), and 'Cell XIV (Portrait)' (2000), for which Bourgeois uses three heads of fabric sculpture to represent the multiple and contradictory aspects of a single individual. Among the highlights are two late masterpieces, the cycle of 14 monumental drawings 'A L’Infini' (2008–9) and the artist’s final vitrine, 'Untitled' (2010).\n\n'Louise Bourgeois, A Woman Without Secrets' was organised in collaboration with Jerry Gorovoy of the Louise Bourgeois Studio and The Easton Foundation, which very generously lent a number of major sculptural works including 'Spiral Woman' (1984) and a giant 'Spider' (1994). The exhibition was further augmented through the loan of several key works from Tate’s collection, including 'Avenza' (1968–9), 'Cell (Eyes and Mirrors)' (1989–93) and a group of late works in red gouache, dating from 2007–9.\n\nThe exhibition was complemented by a major presentation of Louise Bourgeois' works on paper at the Fruitmarket Gallery. Edinburgh. Curated by Frances Morris, 'Louise Bourgeois: I Give Everything Away' presented the artist's 'Insomnia Drawings' (1994-95) alongside two sequences of much larger works on paper, 'When Did This Happen?' (2007) and 'I Give Everything Away' (2010).\n\n'Future Bourgeois: A Symposium and Workshop for new work on Louise Bourgeois' was organised by the ARTIST ROOMS Research Partnership, The Fruitmarket Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland and took place on 7 February 2014. This one-day symposium workshop showcased new research on Bourgeois and related themes and ideas, including artists whose work flourished late in their lives, the appropriation of psychoanalytic ideas as the content of art, the critical fortunes of Bourgeois in relation to feminist, psychoanalytic and other art histories, and work on the technical and collaborative aspects of Bourgeois’s practice (casting, construction, printmaking etc). The ARTIST ROOMS Research Partnership is led by University of Edinburgh and directed by Prof Neil Cox, and is devoted to a programme of research encompassing consisting of three main strands: Art and its Histories, Learning and Engagement and Technical and Conservation Research.\n\n"

    "body": "Among the most important European artists of the twentieth century, Joseph Beuys was known for performances and sculptural installations that explored myth, politics and man’s relationship to the natural world. He saw creativity as central to human existence, and his art was rooted in processes of change and transformation. His sculptures were often based on found objects which he invested with symbolic associations derived from science, anthropology and his own life.\n\nThis exhibition at the National Museum Cardiff brought together a range of work in different media from the extensive holdings of Joseph Beuys in the ARTIST ROOMS collection. Installed in a dedicated space in the Museum’s newly opened galleries for modern and contemporary art, the display made powerful connections with adjacent displays from the Museum’s own outstanding collection of post-1950 art.\n\nIn particular, the exhibition revealed Beuys’ longstanding interest in the survival of the Celtic spirit in northern Europe. Reference was made to Beuys’ contribution to the exhibition 'How the Past Perishes – How the Future Becomes', organised by Caroline Tisdall for the Wrexham Eisteddfod in 1977. The artist saw the Wrexham event as an extension of his seminal installation 'Honeypump' at Documenta 6. Beuys’ interest in the Celtic, and its particular relevance to audiences in Wales, was explored in accompanying events and a schools programme."

The slow and contemplative nature of the artist's work considers human experience from birth through to death. Deceptively simple in style and widely engaging, his works also reflect his interest in painting and photography. This exhibition at the Dick Institute in Kilmarnock, the largest contemporary gallery space in Scotland south of Glasgow and Edinburgh, included two Viola works held in ARTIST ROOMS, Catherine’s Room 2001 and Four Hands 2001.\n\nFour groundbreaking workshops were offered to schools and groups as part of the Bill Viola Exhibition Learning Programme. Three East Ayrshire schools - Grange Academy, Kilmarnock Academy and Park School - and Kilmarnock College worked with artists and the Cultural and Countryside Arts Development team to each create a challenging and unique piece of video art. These DVDs were then supplied to supporters of ARTIST ROOMS including Tate and National Galleries Scotland, before they were screened in front of an invited audience.\n\nThe screening was the first time the groups had seen their own work presented, and an informal award ceremony gave the groups the chance to meet. After the viewing they were each presented with a DVD copy of their work. Chris MacKenzie, Art Lecturer at Kilmarnock College, said: \"Being part of the Bill Viola exhibition is a unique opportunity for the students of Kilmarnock College specialising in art. The learning workshops were a once in a lifetime opportunity to be a part of the world's leading figure in contemporary video art. The education project was truly inspirational and a fantastic learning experience for the students.\""

Many of his walks have taken him through remote areas of Britain while others have been as far afield as Nepal, Africa, Mexico and Bolivia. Long's journeys are documented with photographs, maps, wall drawings and printed statements. He has explained that while his sculptural works feed the senses, the text works feed the imagination."

The artist records his walks, and the discreet sculptures he makes in the landscape through photography, maps and text pieces that together explore the geometry of the environment. He has also used organic materials such as slate, flint or sticks to make floor-based sculptures and frequently integrates mud into drawings and wall-works. Richard Long first presented an exhibition at Abbot Hall in 1985. Twenty-six years later, this ARTIST ROOMS show offered visitors the opportunity to explore the artist’s practice across his extensive career."

His art is often compared to pop and conceptual art but nonetheless escapes easy categorisation. His influence extends beyond painting into the publication of artists' books, of which format Ruscha was a contemporary pioneer.\n\nWolverhampton Art Gallery's presentation of early drawings and key paintings provided a representative snapshot of the series made by the artist from the 1960s through to 2005. Highlights include the early typographic work Honk 1962 and The Music from the Balconies 1984, a major oil painting presented to the ARTIST ROOMS collection by the artist in 2009. The exhibition was conceived as a part of Wolverhampton’s programme of exhibiting works by major artists associated with the pop art movement."

His appropriation of domestic items for the purposes of artistic composition recalls the classical still-life, but his use of proportion, material and space connects his work to architecture.\n\nThis major exhibition, entitled Robert Therrien: Smoke Signals, featured the signature installation No Title (Table and Four Chairs) in Tate Liverpool's Wolfson Room, as well as other large scale sculptures and a selection of Therrien’s surprisingly intimate works on paper."

    "body": "The Canadian-American artist Agnes Martin was among the most important painters and drawers of her generation, with her simultaneously restrained and expressive work often thought of as a bridge between the schools of abstract expressionism and minimalism that dominated painterly practice in the decades following the Second World War.\n\nThis exhibition at Tate St Ives featured late paintings in which signature horizontal bands are made with pure colour watered down to create ethereal washes, often applied with a tactile, painterly handling. During the 1990s, after years of leaving works untitled, Martin began to choose titles such as Happy Holiday and Faraway Love, suggesting universal memories of past happiness and ideals of contentment.\n\nAlthough Martin’s works are in no way representational and the artist always insisted they held no references to landscape, she was inspired by Chinese Tao philosophy and the vast deserts of New Mexico where she resided for most of her life. ‘I want people, when they look at my paintings,’ she noted in 1993, ‘to have the same feelings they experience when they look at landscape… But it’s really about the feeling of beauty and freedom.’"

    "body": "Latvian-American artist Vija Celmins is best known for her highly wrought photo-realistic drawings and paintings. She employs found images, in common with many of her contemporaries who emerged from the Los Angeles art scene of the sixties and seventies. Often taking photographs of natural phenomena as a starting point, her work repeatedly reinterprets the same images, initially captured by camera or telescope, to produce intricate portraits of such delicate scenes as deserts, star-filled night skies, oceans and cobwebs. In her prints and drawings she explores traditional printing techniques and the material density of charcoal, graphite and ink.\n\nHer exhibition at Gracefield Arts Centre, Dumfries, presented twenty-five works on paper spanning the period from 1974 to 2002, showcasing important examples of her signature themes. The exhibition featured four unique drawings, including the early Untitled (Desert-Galaxy) 1974 and Web #1 2001. Accompanied by a selection of four prints of the same subject, this drawing was the first in a major series of works that Celmins made of spider’s webs, reflecting the delicate, web-like construction of the universe. Other works in the collection include an important series from the entitledConcentric Bearings which explores different images of turning space."

Since the 1980s, the artist has made use of references reminiscent of pop art in his use of popular imagery and in his means of production. His brightly coloured sculptures and reliefs, often employing highly reflective surfaces and made with extraordinary precision, also recall the heady excesses of the Baroque.\n\nThis extended display at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art brought together the major group of works by Koons held in ARTIST ROOMS. From the early New Hoover Convertibles, Green, Red, Brown, New Shelton Wet/Dry 10 Gallon Displaced Doubledecker 1981-7, to the basketball piece Encased - Four Rows 1983-93, to Winter Bears 1988 and a selection of works from his Made in Heaven series, the collection offers the opportunity for audiences to explore some of the artist’s most important and iconic series."

    "body": "The American painter Alex Katz began working in the 1950s, focusing on figurative subjects which set him apart from the avant-garde mainstream but brought him public recognition in the 1980s when many young artists began to work in related ways. Although best-known for large-scale portraits, painted in his distinctive, stylised manner, Katz has also consistently made small paintings, many of them conceived initially as studies, which can be considered as a distinct body of work.\n\nKatz has twenty such small paintings in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, which span his career. All of the portraits in the collection depict the artists’ friends or family, including his son Vincent, a habitual model for Katz since his birth in 1960, and many of the landscapes derive from the Maine coast, where Katz has spent summers since the beginning of his career."

'Major Works from Four Decades' featured works on paper made in the period between 1962 and 2005. Standout pieces in the exhibition included 'Red Rooster' (1996), 'Dirty Baby' (1976), 'Hollywood Tantrum' (1979), 'Mad Scientist' (1975) and 'Standard Study #3' (1963). Taken together, these works demonstrated how this Los Angeles-based artist revolutionised our understanding of the relationship between written and visual symbols."

    "body": "The German artist Gerhard Richter is among the most revolutionary and influential painters of the past fifty years.\n\nRichter began his ongoing investigation into the process of painting during the 1960s, and, as can be seen from his book entitled The Daily Practice of Painting 1992, it has sustained him ever since. He identified three broad areas of activity in painting: figurative, constructive and abstract, but the categories overlap and the artist may also use early works as a reservoir of ideas to be developed later.\n\nDuring the 1960s and into the 1970s Richter’s work was primarily figurative but the realist tendency is always balanced by the care he takes to distance it from naturalism, by using photographs. He paints his images in shades of grey, or in black and white, and blurs and simplifies them by brushing over the wet paint. This arbitrary intervention also disassociates the work from the personal responses of the artist and makes it seem more abstract.\n\nIn portraits such as Brigid Polk 1971 and Gilbert, George 1975, both included in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, there is a similar blurring effect. In 48 Portraits 1971-98 realism is tempered by the black and white photo reproduction source from an encyclopaedia which makes these images seem both primitive and iconic, and perhaps closer to propaganda than portraiture.\n\nThe collection of Richter works included in the ARTIST ROOMS collection spans all aspects of the artist’s complex practice and includes unique works in many different media, from Two Sculptures for a Room by Palermo 1971 to the recent glass sculpture 11 Scheiben 2004.\n\nLeicester Museums & Galleries hold an internationally renowned collection of German expressionist art, which made a compelling context for this exhibition devoted to Richter."

His practice, from the late 1960s onwards, attest to the manner in which Kiefer has worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatised nation and a divided world. Since the 1980s his focus has expanded from that of Germany’s role in civilisation to the fate of art and culture in general, opening out to include ideas of national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The exhibition includes more recent works that address some of these themes. In the words of historian Simon Schama, they present ‘a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur’.\n\nAmong the works to be included in this exhibition at the BALTIC were three paintings from the artist's early 'Parsifal' series (1973), drawn from Richard Wagner’s last opera of the same name, a work hugely influential upon Germanic culture. In 'Palette' (1981), Kiefer revealed the problematic legacy inherited by artists in post-war Germany: the artist's palette hangs from a single burning thread evoking shame, loss and the apparent impossibility of artistic creation."

His work, often collaborative and in a wide variety of materials including stone carvings, constructions and neon lighting, is a unique blend of art and poetry. Sailing Dinghy encapsulates the artist's passion for ships and the sea, the boat was used by Ian Hamilton Finlay himself and is accompanied by a poem which evokes its movement. Much of his early poetry concerns sailing and fishing boats."

In 1956, he enrolled at the Chouinard Art Institute, where he studied fine art alongside typesetting and graphic design. By the early 1960s, he was perceived to have to have created a new form of visual landscape combining typography with commonplace objects. Over the past half-century, Ruscha’s art has evolved in unpredictable ways. At the same time, the things that first fired his imagination – cinema and film; driving, roadside signs, and the flat, featureless landscapes of the American West; the city, filled with constant visual noise; the phenomenon of human communication and the pleasures of typography – remain the basis for his art. The drawings in this touring exhibition show the range of Ruscha’s practice and the centrality of drawing to his career."

    "body": "American artist Robert Mapplethorpe pushed the boundaries of photography in both his subject choice and technique. This has led to him sometimes being remembered for his controversial and often explicit images. However, the outstanding collection of Mapplethorpe photographs in ARTIST ROOMS allows these controversial works to be considered in the context of his entire oeuvre.\n\nMapplethorpe became famous, not to say notorious, in the 1970s and 1980s for his photographs of the male nude and sexually explicit gay imagery. With these images he tested the right to individual freedom - they were not meant to be titillating, shocking or obscene, but beautiful in a traditionally classical way. His work therefore holds a significant place in the history of artistic struggle to depict the world as it is with honesty and truth.\n\nIn 1988 Mapplethorpe stated: “I don’t like that particular word ‘shocking.’ I’m looking for the unexpected. I’m looking for things I’ve never seen before... I was in a position to take those pictures. I felt an obligation to do them.” Yet Mapplethorpe also photographed more traditional subjects, such as flowers (in particular Orchids and Calla Lilies), formal portraits and classical nudes. His understanding of form and light, and his meticulous compositions create truly beautiful images that revel in the sensual quality of nature and the human body.\n\nThe exhibition at Towner, East Sussex, presented Mapplethorpe's work alongside New Documents, Brighton Photo Biennial 2010. Mapplethorpe’s work thereby provided an historical context to the discussion of cutting edge contemporary photographic practice."

The architect John McAslan was among those who campaigned to restore the hall. At the heart of its ethos, the Burgh Hall is committed to delivering a range of cultural experiences not previously available to the local community of Dunoon and the wider region. In this respect it shares the aims and values of ARTIST ROOMS."

Whether encountered on city streets or in art galleries, Holzer's work asks us to consider the words and messages that surround us. Her art takes many forms, including stone benches, projections, signs, posters, paintings, plaques and textiles. Words are central to her work, whether pasted on a wall, flickering from an electronic sign, carved in granite or stitched in wool.\n\nHer texts can be forceful and apparently simple, but may contradict one another. They are not necessarily straightforward expressions of the artist’s views. Truisms, Holzer’s first text series, is a survey of belief.\n\nHolzer has described her aims:\n\nI wanted a lot simultaneously: to leave art outside for the public, to be a painter of mysterious yet ordered works, to be explicit but not didactic, to find the right subjects, to transform spaces, to disorient and transfix people, to offer up beauty, to be funny and never lie.\n\nEarly in her career, Holzer delivered messages on posters and T-shirts so they would be seen in everyday places rather than in museums and galleries. Her work addresses the information overload and multiple perspectives we read daily. Eye-catching or quiet and lyrical, Holzer's art invites us to read and interpret for ourselves."

The earliest works in the exhibition, from the late 1960s, attest to the manner in which Kiefer has worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatised nation and a divided world. Since the 1980s his focus has expanded from that of Germany’s role in civilisation to the fate of art and culture in general, opening out to include ideas of national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The exhibition includes more recent works that address some of these themes. In the words of historian Simon Schama, they present ‘a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur.’\n\nTo celebrate the Anselm Kiefer ARTIST ROOMS exhibition, Mostyn presented a unique illustrated and free-to-attend conversation between Anthony d’Offay and Amy Dickson, the collection’s Managing Curator, in February 2012."

This major show comprised posters, drawings, paintings and sculpture from the ARTIST ROOMS collection alongside loans from private and public collections.\n\nSpeaking about the exhibition in the accompanying catalogue, Anthony d'Offay said that \"Warhol is among those great artists whose life seems at first sight to have ended abruptly but who nonetheless left behind a body of work that feels complete. His late work, in its relentless obsession with mortality, suggests that a circle is being closed, that the artist possessed an intuitive understanding of his own impending death... His work is strangely prophetic. To such a degree that twenty-five years after his death it feels that his paintings are commenting directly on now.\""

This exhibition at the Hunterian Art Gallery included examples of the artist’s works on paper together with a small selection of additional works, notably his ‘vitrines’, including the legendary Fat Chair, and an iconic portrait of Beuys by Andy Warhol.\n\nThis ARTIST ROOMS exhibition was staged as a collaborative venture between the Hunterian and the Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art (GI)."

This has led to him sometimes being remembered exclusively for his controversial and often explicit images. However, the outstanding collection of Mapplethorpe photographs in ARTIST ROOMS allows these ‘controversial’ works to be considered in the context of his entire oeuvre.\n\nMapplethorpe became famous, not to say, notorious, in the 1970s and 1980s for his photographs of the male nude and sexually explicit gay imagery. With these images he tested the right to individual freedom - they were not meant to be titillating, shocking or obscene, but beautiful in a traditionally classical way. His work therefore holds a significant place in the history of artistic struggle to depict the world as it is with honesty and truth.\n\nIn 1988 Mapplethorpe stated: “I don’t like that particular word ‘shocking.’ I’m looking for the unexpected. I’m looking for things I’ve never seen before... I was in a position to take those pictures. I felt an obligation to do them.” Yet Mapplethorpe also photographed more traditional subjects, such as flowers (in particular Orchids and Calla Lilies), formal portraits and classical nudes. His understanding of form and light, and his meticulous compositions create truly beautiful images that revel in the sensual quality of nature and the human body.\n\nThis was Sheffield's very first exhibition of works by Mapplethorpe, and featured highlights from throughout the artist’s career."

    "body": "The Belgian artist and filmmaker Johan Grimonprez came to prominence when this highly-acclaimed montage was shown in 1997. The work traces the history of airplane hijackings through found video footage and televised images. Grimonprez juxtaposes this central narrative with references to the Cold War and quotations from Don DeLillo’s novels White Noise and Mao II.\n\nExamining the abundance of information available via the media, much of which is spectacular and sensationalist, Grimonprez acknowledges the hidden or unseen events which cannot be recorded. He thus presents the viewer with the potential impossibility of documenting historical fact."

BLUE PURPLE TILT, 2007 is a 4m high light installation with panels each measuring 3810x137x1270cm creates an impressive visual presence in the double-height main gallery of the Marks Barfield Architects’ designed building that holds the prestigious Art Fund Prize 2008. The exhibition also has two large paintings by the American artist entitled Protect, Protect, 2007, and Shape the Battlespace, 2007, in which Holzer presents declassified American military documents relating to the war in Iraq. Both pieces are oil on linen and are large scale, each measuring 2007 x 2597cm.\n\nThe Lightbox Director Marilyn Scott says: “It is a tremendous coup for us, a regional, young gallery, and one of only two chosen in the South East, to be included in this highly influential touring collection. Holzer’s dynamic thought-provoking work aligns well with the creative, inspirational and educational programmes which The Lightbox, that opened less than two years ago, aims to bring to its various target audiences throughout the year.”"

    "body": "Robert Therrien’s gigantic sculpture No Title (Table and Four Chairs) 2003 filled the central gallery of a display exploring scale.\n\nRobert Therrien (b. 1947) presents a world of the unexpected filled with objects which are both familiar and strange. It can seem a fairytale place of deceptively childish charm and logic where ideas can literally be translated into reality. Inanimate things can become strikingly animated, soft and light become hard and heavy and size seems out of control.\n\nDuring the 1980s the artist began to make objects with simple, recognisable shapes such as jugs, coffins and doors, transforming them through a variety of media including copper, wood and bronze. This developed his engagement with the notion of the found object, addressed most explicitly in his found brick paper drawings. His work with changing scale began in the early 1990s. Some objects he uses are found, some are made by and for the artist. His use of domestic images might suggest an interest in the spatial world of still-life but his interest in the human body’s interaction with space is more connected to architecture. Therrien’s images and the objects he selects expose the hidden drama of the unnoticed, invisible, physical and mental relationships which exist in the world of human beings, between human beings and between the objects they create to help them live their lives."

    "body": "The Los Angeles-based artist Ed Ruscha is one of the most consistently inventive American artists of the last fifty years. Ruscha’s work explores his fascination with the enigmatic power of language, and is heavily influence by the glossy, democratic, sun-kissed culture of the American West Coast in the second half of the twentieth century. His art is often compared to pop and conceptual Art but nonetheless escapes easy categorisation. His influence extends beyond painting into the publication of artists' books, of which format Ruscha was a contemporary pioneer.\n\nFor this exhibition, six ARTIST ROOMS including Robert Therrien’s gigantic sculpture No Title (Table and Four Chairs) 2003 filled the central gallery of a display exploring scale. Other highlights included major paintings by Ed Ruscha and Andy Warhol in the States of Flux galleries on Level 5. Works by Jannis Kounellis and Anselm Kiefer were shown in a suite of galleries dedicated to the arte povera movement."

Since 1970 Gilbert & George have been important figures in the international art world.\n\nWorking as a pair and presenting themselves as ‘living sculpture’, incorporating themselves into their art, they set out to provoke their viewers, making them think and question conventions and taboos. Their early work emphasised the artists’ own image, their place as misfits in society and their concept of ‘art for all’. But by the late 70s their work explored the world and the people around them in the East End of London."

Almost unrivalled in terms of commercial success, Koons fittingly started his career in New York as a commodities broker. In the 1980s he established himself as an artist, setting up a studio with assistants and operating in a way similar to Andy Warhol’s Factory.\n\nUsing everyday items and oversized images from popular culture, Koons explores ideas of culture and taste, questioning the established values of the art world. Not one to shun publicity, Koons has become the ultimate poster-boy for consumerism, making himself as much a commodity as the art he creates."

His practice, from the late 1960s onwards, attest to the manner in which Kiefer has worked with the conviction that art could heal a traumatised nation and a divided world. Since the 1980s his focus has expanded from that of Germany’s role in civilisation to the fate of art and culture in general, opening out to include ideas of national identity and collective memory, but also occult symbolism, theology and mysticism. The exhibition includes more recent works that address some of these themes. In the words of historian Simon Schama, they present \"a resonant meditation on the instability of built grandeur\".\n\nPalm Sunday (2006) is a monumental installation consisting of a felled palm tree and thirty-six steel-and-glass reliquary tablets. This installation went on show in a suite of galleries at the Tate Modern dedicated to the arte povera movement.\n\n"
