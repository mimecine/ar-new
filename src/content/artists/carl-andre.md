Andre’s signature practice of taking existing raw or factory-finished elements, often of wood or metal or bricks and arranging them directly on the gallery floor, focusses the viewer’s awareness of shared space.  Informed by his experience of 'blue collar' industrial work, Andre allows the character of material to speak for itself whilst the mesmerising simplicity of pattern instills a therapeutic aura of calm.
