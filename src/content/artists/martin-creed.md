Martin Creed (b. 1968) is among the most restlessly creative artists at work today. He takes commonplace events and objects as the subject of, and the material for, art that celebrates everyday life. His magpie enthusiasm for the beautiful and strange all about us is expressed in a wide variety of forms, including performance, film, painting, installation and music.

Some of Creed's works are very large, and some are very small. Some are easily recognisable as art - paintings and drawings - while others are not - a scrunched up ball of paper, or the lights going on and off in an otherwise empty room. All of them are nonetheless identified primarily by a number, granting them equal status irrespective of their size or fame. This democratic spirit is indicative of Creed's approach to art and the world around us, open to the possibility that the most insignificant-seeming thing can be a source of beauty and wonder, and should be treated as such.

This generosity of spirit is also evident in Creed's donation of a significant body of work to the ARTIST ROOMS collection to ensure its continued availability to the nation. This includes the neon sign 'Work No. 890 (DON’T WORRY)', a twenty-one part drawing, 'Work No. 944' (2008), and a series of four paintings from 2011.
