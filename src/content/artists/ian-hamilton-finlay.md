Ian Hamilton Finlay (1925 - 2006) combined his love of nature, his garden and the sea with his love of literature and the potency of words. In the 1960s he was already recognised as one of Britain’s foremost concrete poets, but went on to extend his ideas beyond the printed page to become objects in the material world. His work, often collaborative and in a wide variety of media including stone carvings, constructions and neon lighting, is a unique blend of art and poetry. The monumental installation in ARTIST ROOMS, 'Sailing Dinghy', consists of a boat, used by Hamilton Finlay himself, accompanied by a poem which evokes its movement. Much of Hamilton Finlay's early poetry concerns sailing and fishing boats, and this elegant, affectionate piece encapsulates the artist’s passion for ships and the sea.

Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland would like to recognise the artist's generous donation of works to the ARTIST ROOMS collection.
