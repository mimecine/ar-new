This film was made at the time of an ARTIST ROOM of Jenny Holzer's work at the Lightbox, Woking.

Holzer is world-renowned for her outspoken and sometimes confrontational use of language, and the powerful visual impact and strongly political messages of her work have resonated with onlookers. In this film, visitors to Lightbox respond to her work.
