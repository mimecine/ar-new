An introduction to Joseph Beuys using archive footage from some of his iconic performances such as 'How to Explain Pictures to a Dead Hare', 1963, as well as audio of the artist discussing some of his influences, beliefs and motivations.

The film was produced to coincide with the exhibition 'ARTIST ROOMS: Joseph Beuys â€“ A Language of Drawing', which for the first time brings together the extraordinary group of over 110 Beuys drawings held in the ARTIST ROOMS collection.
