We visit Woodhorn Museum for their Art Gala Day hosted by The Mindfuls, a group of young people established to explore and celebrate the ARTIST ROOMS exhibition of text based words by American artist Lawrence Weiner. We hear from The Mindfuls and staff at Woodhorn about how the exhibition has changed the way they work and how it fits into the mining history of the incredible site in Northumberland.
