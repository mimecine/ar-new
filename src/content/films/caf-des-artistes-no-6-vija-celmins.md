Dr Catherine Spencer and Dr Stephanie Straine hosted a participatory discussion on Vija Celmins at 6.30pm on Tuesday 3 June at the Fruitmarket Gallery. This was the first Café des Artistes at which there was a virtual link-up between Edinburgh and an institution hosting an ARTIST ROOMS exhibition, in this case Taigh Chearsabhagh Museum & Art Centre in North Uist, which exhibited Vija Celmins's work from March to June 2014. Participants in North Uist were not only able to hear the talks and discussions but also able to join in via Twitter
