There are not many places on earth where paintings of Popeye mingle with giant lobsters, or where a team can scheme to hang a full-sized train from a crane.

But as this episode of TateShots proves, anything is possible in the studio ofÂ Jeff Koons. Fresh from exhibiting his work at the Palace of Versailles - the first time a contemporary artist has been invited to exhibit there- the boundary-breaking artist gave us a whistle-stop tour of his factory-like facility.
