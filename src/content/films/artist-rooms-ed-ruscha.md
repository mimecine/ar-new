Wolverhampton Art Gallery presents an extended exhibition of works by Los Angeles-based artist Ed Ruscha, one of the most consistently inventive American artists of the last fifty years. Ruscha's work explores his fascination with the power and enigma of language and the culture of the American West Coast. His art has much in common with Pop art but escapes easy categorisation.
