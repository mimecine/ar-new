American artist Ellen Gallagher has Irish and African American origins, which have shaped the texture and subject matter of her practice. On the occasion of her solo exhibition at Tate Modern, playwright Bonnie Greer explains what it is about Gallagher's gorgeously intricate and highly imaginative works that she finds so powerful and important.
