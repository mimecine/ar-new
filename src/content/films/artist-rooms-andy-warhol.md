Exhibitions of Andy Warhol's work at Southampton City Art Gallery and the John Hansard Gallery brought work from the ARTIST ROOMS collection to the city for the first time. 

Andy Warhol (1928 -- 1987) is one of the most influential artists of the 20th century and this major exhibition will bring together paintings, prints, posters, photographs and film to examine Warhol's fascination with fame and celebrity and to give audiences an overview of his work from 1962 until his death in 1987.
