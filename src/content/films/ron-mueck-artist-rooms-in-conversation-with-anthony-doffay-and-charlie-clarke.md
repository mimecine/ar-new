For our third ARTIST ROOMS presentation, we are showing the work of internationally renowned sculptor Ron Mueck.
His work explores timeless themes, encouraging us as viewers to identify with the human condition. He plays with scale and placement to create dramatic narratives which link the real world with myth and folklore.
The exhibition includes work on loan from Tate/NGS ARTIST ROOMS collection and pieces from private collections rarely seen in the UK.
ARTIST ROOMS On Tour is a partnership with Arts Council England and the Art Fund, making available the ARTIST ROOMS collection of international modern and contemporary art to galleries throughout the UK. ARTIST ROOMS is jointly owned by Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland and was established through the d'Offay Donation in 2008, with the assistance of the National Heritage Memorial Fund, the Art Fund and the Scottish and British Governments.
