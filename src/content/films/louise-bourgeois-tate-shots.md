Louise Bourgeois was born in Paris in 1911 where her parents ran a tapestry gallery. At 27 she moved to New York City after marrying American art historian Robert Goldwater. She began her career with paintings and drawings in the 1940s and by the 1960s had begun to experiment with wood, plaster, latex and other solid materials to create bold and subversive sculptural forms.

In this film her friend and assistant of over 30 years Jerry Gorovoy explains the childhood trauma and pain Bourgeois was communicating through her work. Tate Modern director Frances Morris describes her first time meeting the artist and discusses the multi-layered themes of loneliness and conflict, frustration and vulnerability in Bourgeoisâ€™s prolific career.
