Glitch (January 2017) - a Roy Lichtenstein inspired graffiti mural by ArtForum, the young ambassadors group at Wolverhampton Art Gallery.

Taking the ARTIST ROOMS: Roy Lichtenstein exhibition at Wolverhampton Art Gallery as their starting point, young people aged 14 to 25 from the gallery’s ArtForum youth group have designed and created this mural inspired by the American Pop Art icon, with artist Gregor Laird.
