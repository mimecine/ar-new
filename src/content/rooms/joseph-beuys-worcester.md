This exhibition brings together a selection of Beuys' later works in which the symbolism of his signature materials is deeply embedded, including five where his own Braunkreuz oil paint present a metaphor of the living systems of earth. Alongside these, a series of posters from Beuys' actions highlight the importance of debate and the intersection of environmental protest and art.

Worcester is often considered by British politicians as a yard stick of political option. Fox-hunting and badger-culling, alternative energy generation, the impact of growth on the green belt, industrial agriculture interests vs the environment – all these issues have real strength of feeling in the community. The Worcestershire museum collections reflect the importance of the land beneath our feet on English society and ARTIST ROOMS Joseph Beuys is part of an ongoing programme of work exploring landscape in its widest sense.

In common with Museums Worcestershire's approach to programming and staying true to Beuys' ideals, debate will form an important part of the exhibition: the Everyone is an Artist room will take Beuys' famous quotation and ask visitors to respond. A young people's group will be working with the exhibition to harness ideas into artworks and performances. On Saturday 1st February 2014, Worcestershire – Contemporary Art (W-CA) will curate a Live Art Day of actions.
