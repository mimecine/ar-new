Roy Lichtenstein (1923-1997) was one of the most radical and influential artists of the twentieth century. With great integrity to materials and techniques, and with intellectual rigour and wit, Lichtenstein created visually striking works that continue to provoke questions about how images permeate our lives. This special three-room display will bring together a newly assembled group of works by Lichtenstein, made possible thanks to the generosity of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation and the Estate of Roy Lichtenstein.
