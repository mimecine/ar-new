The paintings of Alex Katz, whose cool, figurative works are popularly associated with the pop art movement, and Cy Twombly, whose powerful, spontaneous painting style incorporated romanticism, symbolism and expressionism, represent two very different styles of painting. The juxtaposition of their work in the beautiful setting of remote Orkney, however, highlights the simple beauty of these two very different artists' work.

The exhibition at the Pier Arts Centre in Stromness includes twenty small paintings by Alex Katz spanning forty years from the late 1960s and a powerful eight part work by Cy Twombly, in watercolour and gouache, from 1979. Beautiful Being allowed audiences on this Scottish archipelago to view work by two of the leading, and most naturally gifted, painters of our time.
