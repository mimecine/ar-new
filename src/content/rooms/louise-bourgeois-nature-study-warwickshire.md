Displayed across the galleries, collections and extending into the Capability Brown landscape at Compton Verney, this exhibition explores Bourgeois’s interest in the cycles of life and nature. It features over forty works, including one of the last large-scale works made prior to her death, A l’Infini (2008-09).

This exhibition is presented in collaboration with ARTIST ROOMS and The Easton Foundation.

Compton Verney is an award-winning gallery based in a Grade I-listed Georgian mansion, amid 120 acres of Grade II-listed Lancelot 'Capability' Brown parkland in Warwickshire. Alongside six permanent collection displays (Naples, Northern European Art 1450-1650, British Portraits, Chinese, British Folk Art & The Marx Lambert Collection), Compton Verney has a schedule of thought-provoking changing exhibitions and events, both indoors and out.
