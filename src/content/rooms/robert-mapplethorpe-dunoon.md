The work of the revolutionary American photographer Robert Mapplethorpe toured galleries in Scotland as part of the ARTIST ROOMS 2012 programme. The Burgh Hall in Dunoon exhibited sixteen works, exploring the social and political threads of Mapplethorpe's provocative output.

The Burgh Hall re-opened in spring 2009 as an arts-led community venue, offering a diverse programme of exhibitions, performances, community activities, youth theatre, dance and more. The architect John McAslan was among those who campaigned to restore the hall. At the heart of its ethos, the Burgh Hall is committed to delivering a range of cultural experiences not previously available to the local community of Dunoon and the wider region. In this respect it shares the aims and values of ARTIST ROOMS.
