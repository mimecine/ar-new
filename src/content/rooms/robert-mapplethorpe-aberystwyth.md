Aberystwyth Arts Centre is Wales’ largest arts centre. It has a wide-ranging artistic programme across all art forms, both producing and presenting; and is recognised as a national flagship for the arts.

For its first project with ARTIST ROOMS, Aberystwyth Arts Centre will present an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe’s photography. Mapplethorpe is recognised as one of the key artists of the late 20th century and the Centre is delighted to be able to bring this outstanding collection of his work to its audiences. Encompassing self portraits and portraits from throughout the artist’s career, as well as a selection of still life works, the exhibition will allow audiences in Wales to experience something of the quality and the range of Mapplethorpe’s extraordinary oeuvre.

The exhibition will be accompanied by an innovative learning and participation programme to engage and develop audiences throughout the showing period, which will include events instigated and directed by young people from the area.
