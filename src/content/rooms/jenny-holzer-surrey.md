As a selected gallery for part of this wonderful collection, The Lightbox gallery and museum is proud to have its Main Gallery illuminated by the stunning BLUE PURPLE TILT, 2007 which has been especially created for by Jenny Holzer for ARTIST ROOMS. BLUE PURPLE TILT, 2007 is a 4m high light installation with panels each measuring 3810x137x1270cm creates an impressive visual presence in the double-height main gallery of the Marks Barfield Architects’ designed building that holds the prestigious Art Fund Prize 2008. The exhibition also has two large paintings by the American artist entitled Protect, Protect, 2007, and Shape the Battlespace, 2007, in which Holzer presents declassified American military documents relating to the war in Iraq. Both pieces are oil on linen and are large scale, each measuring 2007 x 2597cm.

The Lightbox Director Marilyn Scott says: “It is a tremendous coup for us, a regional, young gallery, and one of only two chosen in the South East, to be included in this highly influential touring collection. Holzer’s dynamic thought-provoking work aligns well with the creative, inspirational and educational programmes which The Lightbox, that opened less than two years ago, aims to bring to its various target audiences throughout the year.”
