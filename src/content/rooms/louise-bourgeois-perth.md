Often autobiographical and intensely psychological, the influential French – American artist’s work covers themes such as birth, death, love, loss and fear. Although her career spanned seven decades, Bourgeois was most prolific in later life, when she created the famous spider sculptures which made her one of the most recognisable artists today.
