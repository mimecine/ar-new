Johan Grimonprez is a Belgian multimedia artist, filmmaker, and curator. He is most known for his films Dial H-I-S-T-O-R-Y (1997) which the Guardian included in its article From Warhol to Steve McQueen: a history of video art in 30 works, Double Take (2009) and Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms Trade (2016), based on the book by Andrew Feinstein. Grimonprez is currently developing "SOUNDTRACK TO A COUP D'ETAT" about the promise of decolonisation, the hope of the non-aligned movement and the dream of self-determination.
