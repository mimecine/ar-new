August Sander was a German portrait photographer whose work in the early half of the twentieth century proved enormously important to the development of photographic art. This exhibition of Sander's works presented a selection from the artist's extraordinary documentary project,People of the 20th Century.

Sander sought to catalogue the lives of the entire German people, and in doing so created an unprecedented record of human society. The exhibition was taken from a major collection of over 170 modern prints. The prints were produced from the original plates by August Sander’s grandson, Gerd Sander, who himself is a photographer and master printer. Together the collection of photographs gives a brilliant overview of Sander’s achievements as an artist, photographer and recorder of history.
