ARTIST ROOMS is bringing a collection of works by Richard Long to The Potteries Museum & Art Gallery in Stoke as part of the 2013 tour. Richard Long first came to prominence during the late 1960s. He was among a generation of British artists who wanted to extend the possibilities of sculpture beyond the confines of traditional materials.

Long’s work is rooted in his deep affinity with nature, developed during solitary walks. Many of his walks have taken him through remote areas of Britain while others have been as far afield as Nepal, Africa, Mexico and Bolivia. Long's journeys are documented with photographs, maps, wall drawings and printed statements. He has explained that while his sculptural works feed the senses, the text works feed the imagination.
