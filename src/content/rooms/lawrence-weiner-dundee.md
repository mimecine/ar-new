Dundee's first chance to see works from the ARTIST ROOMS collection of modern and contemporary art.

Influential conceptual artist, Lawrence Weiner uses language as his medium. His text work takes many forms, but the core principle remains the same – his ideas should not be confined to the gallery but taken up by the viewer. Adopting this principle, The McManus have worked with the artist to present his texts in different forms. One cycle of wall texts will be presented in Scots – translated by distinguished author James Robertson. Texts will also be installed within museum displays around the building – the text resonating alongside Dundee’s rich collections of natural history, archaeology, world cultures, industrial machinery and the spectacular architecture of The McManus itself.

The exhibition at The McManus will bring together a cycle of wall texts from the ARTIST ROOMS collection with a later wall piece and a selection of posters, drawings, artist books and ephemera from the Tate and The University of Dundee.

The McManus: Dundee's Art Gallery and Museum offers a fascinating insight into the city’s culture and history with more than eight galleries. The venue celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2017 and is home to the city’s fine art, applied art and whaling industry collections. In 2018 the McManus presents its first ARTIST ROOMS exhibition, in the same year that the city celebrates the opening of the V&A Museum of Design, Dundee.
