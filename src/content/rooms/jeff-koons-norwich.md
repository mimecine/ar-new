Norwich Castle Museum & Art Gallery is working with ARTIST ROOMS for the first time, hosting an exhibition of work by American artist, Jeff Koons. Koons is widely regarded as one of the most important, influential, popular, and controversial artists of our time. This exhibition will include works in a variety of media to showcase his originality and remarkably diverse art practice.

The exhibition will be a highlight of the Norfolk & Norwich Festival (8 - 24 May) - a world class festival of music, visual art, theatre, performance, and literature. Norwich Castle is also working in partnership with the Young Norfolk Arts Festival on an innovative project which will see a team of young people using the themes of Koons’ work to engage and develop young audiences.
