Bill Viola presents three works from the ‘Passions’, a series of video works created between 2000 and 2002 that explore human emotions. They are inspired in large part by Viola’s study of European religious paintings of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.

Bill Viola (b. 1951) is an American artist, internationally recognised as having been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art. His works focus on universal human experiences and is renowned for its precision and simplicity while fusing the influences of painting, photography and cinema.

Royal Albert Memorial Museum & Art Gallery (RAMM) is a museum and art gallery in the city of Exeter, Devon. It offers a rich programme of exhibitions and displays and has been a place of discovery for local communities ever since the museum first opened in 1868.
