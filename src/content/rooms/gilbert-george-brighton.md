Get under the skin of the Turner Prize-winning pair Gilbert & George in Brighton

Artist partnership Gilbert (b.1943) & George (b.1942) have worked and shared their lives together for fifty years. Their playful and ambiguous works on display in Brighton, drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, explore themes essential to humanity and contemporary society including sex, faith, and identity. The artists are not afraid to shock their audience in their determination to present a truthful vision of life. The explicit nature of some of their imagery includes male nudity, sexuality and bodily functions, which some people may find challenging.
