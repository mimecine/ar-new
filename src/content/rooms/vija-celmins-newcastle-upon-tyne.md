Vija Celmins takes an in-depth look at the artist’s works on paper. Celmins produces exquisitely intricate drawings and prints of natural phenomena, based upon close observation of photographs, her delicate-seeming work addresses subjects that are both powerful and timeless.

This exhibition includes unique graphite, charcoal and eraser drawings such as Untitled (Desert-Galaxy) 1974 and Web #1 1999, as well as prints which employ intaglio, lithographic and relief processes.

Hatton Gallery based at Newcastle University has been at the heart of cultural life in the North East since the early 20th century. Founded in 1925, today it is a modern exhibition space with inclusive programming and home to the Hatton’s diverse collection with over 3,000 works from the 14th – 20th centuries.
