August Sander was a German portrait photographer whose work in the early half of the twentieth century proved enormously important to the development of photographic art. This exhibition of Sander's works presented a selection from the artist's extraordinary documentary project, 'People of the 20th Century'. Sander sought to catalogue the lives of the entire German people, and in doing so created an unprecedented record of human society.

Curated by August Sander’s grandson, Gerd Sander, the selection of work reflected his understanding both of Sander’s technical genius and the context in which the photographs were produced, knowing many of the stories behind the sitters and their relationship to Sander. The exhibition was presented alongside Leicester’s internationally acclaimed collection of twentieth-century German Expressionist art, and a touring exhibition of George Grosz from the Hayward Gallery. The ARTIST ROOMS exhibition therefore offered a unique opportunity to view Sander’s work alongside great German artists from the same period.
