Stunning works by Andy Warhol brought together for inaugural exhibition at Dunoon Burgh Hall. A selection of iconic portraits and self-portraits by the world-famous US pop artist Andy Warhol is to feature in the inaugural exhibition at Dunoon Burgh Hall, which will re-open in June following its recent transformational restoration. 

Andy Warhol (1928-87) is a giant of modern art, who created some of the most memorable images of the last century. He began his career as a successful commercial artist, working in advertising in the 1950s, but also began to work as an independent ‘fine’ artist. He became a leading figure of American Pop Art, which emerged in New York in the early 1960s. A central concern in his work was the increasing power of the popular media - advertising, film and television - in shaping the way we view the world, and particularly in encouraging the cult of celebrity.
