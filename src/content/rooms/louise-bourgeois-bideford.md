With a career spanning eight decades from the 1930s until 2010, Louise Bourgeois is one of the great figures of modern and contemporary art. She is best known for her large-scale sculptures and installations that are inspired by her own memories and experiences. Using drawings, prints, sculpture and fabric works from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, this exhibition takes an in-depth look at Bourgeois's work through the themes and ideas of an extraordinary artist.

The Burton at Bideford is an art gallery and museum that provides local communities with free access to a rich programme of displays and temporary exhibitions. This is the Burton at Bideford's third collaboration with Tate and National Galleries of Scotland through the ARTIST ROOMS programme and follows presentations of internationally renowned artists Richard Long (2014) and Diane Arbus (2018).
