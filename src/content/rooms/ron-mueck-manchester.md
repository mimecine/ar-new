Ron Mueck has become internationally recognised for his unique realist sculptures that replicate the human figure with unrivalled technical skill. The powerful psychological range of Mueck's sculpture focuses not only on universal experiences of birth, life and death but on emotional states such as isolation, fear and tenderness.

The works in ARTIST ROOMS represent the scope of Mueck's approach to the human condition, from the uneasy intimacy of Spooning Couple 2005, the vulnerability of the giant Wild Man (2005), and enigmatic half-smile inMask III 2005.
