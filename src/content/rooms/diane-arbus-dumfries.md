Tracing the development of Arbus’s early work with a 35mm camera from the mid-1950s to the distinctive square format she began using in 1962, the exhibition will include a presentation of A Box of Ten Photographs, a rare portfolio of original prints which Arbus produced shortly before her death by suicide in 1971. Arbus gave considerable thought to what this portfolio should be and how it should look, selecting a set of ten images that date from as early as 1963, comprising some of her most iconic portraits, including Identical twins, Roselle, N.J. 1966 and A Jewish giant at home with his parents in the Bronx, N.Y. 1970. For Arbus, the ten images represented who she was as an artist and how she saw her work in the world, a legacy that became more solidified with her death in 1971.
