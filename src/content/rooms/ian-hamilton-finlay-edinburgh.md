Two text works by Scottish artist Ian Hamilton Finlay have been generously given by the artist’s estate to National Galleries of Scotland and Tate jointly for ARTIST ROOMS. These works beautifully complement the major installation Sailing Dinghy 1996, already held in the collection, and together formed the centrepiece of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art's Spring displays.
