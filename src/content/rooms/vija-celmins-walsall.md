See the work of Latvian-American artist Vija Celmins at The New Art Gallery Walsall.

This exhibition by Celmins (b. 1938) drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection is one of three displays by contemporary artists on show at the New Art Gallery Walsall, which explore the theme of physical or psychological wilderness. Celmins’s densely layered drawings and prints engage with the natural world; the surface of the ocean, expanses of desert, a spider’s web or star-filled night sky. Her images prompt questions around representation, perception and human experience and remind us of the complexity of the simplest things we observe in nature.
