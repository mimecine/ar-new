Discover the pop style of American painter Alex Katz

Alex Katz (born 1927) is highly recognisable and admired by a younger generation of artists and the public. His elegant paintings present a modern, quintessentially American take on the classical themes of portraiture, landscape, figure studies, marine scenes and flowers. A group of works selected from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, this exhibition will provide viewers with the opportunity to see a substantial body of his work. The display will showcase works including Pansies 1967 and West Palm Beach1997.
