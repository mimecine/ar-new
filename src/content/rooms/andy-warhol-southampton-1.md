This major exhibition of Andy Warhol's work across two venues in Southampton brought together paintings, prints, posters, photographs and film to examine the artist's fascination with fame and celebrity and to give audiences an overview of his work from 1962 until his death in 1987.

Southampton City Art Gallery presented a number of major paintings by Warhol, including the six-part multiple Skulls 1976, the four-part mural-size work Camouflage 1986, Dollar Sign 1981 and Portrait of Joseph Beuys1980. A number of Warhol’s later black and white diptych paintings were also on display, including Hamburger 1985-6 and Repent and Sin No More!1985-6. Images of many other popular figures, such as Marilyn Monroe Mick Jagger and The Beatles were exhibited as part of a group of 126 prints and posters. The exhibition also housed a ‘Factory’-style space for education projects and activities.

John Hansard Gallery focused on Warhol’s highly influential film and photography, showcasing rarely-seen stitched photographs, self-portraits, celebrity portraits, and a selection of film works from the Andy Warhol Museum. These include some examples of his iconic Screen Tests, the fascinating Factory Diaries, and some of his experimental film.

The two galleries reported record numbers of visitors to the free exhibitions.
