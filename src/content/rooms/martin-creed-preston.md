Martin Creed is one of the most influential and exciting British artists today, who uses sculpture, neon, painting, video and performance. Awarded the Turner Prize in 2001, he was also chosen to welcome the 2012 London Olympics with a UK-wide bell-ringing performance, from Big Ben to bicycle bells.



The exhibition includes Work No. 203: EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALRIGHT (1999) on the front of the Grade 1 listed Harris building.



This ARTIST ROOMS exhibition features an eclectic range of Creed’s work, and we are delighted to show several of his works for the first time outside London. We are also the first gallery to show Work No. 960 (2008), an installation of 13 cactus plants, since the artist donated it to ARTIST ROOMS, together with another recent gift to the collection, Work No. 1340 (2012): a large-scale painting of diagonal stripes that is applied directly onto the gallery wall.



Visitors can experience one of Creed’s best known installations, the Turner Prize-winning Work No. 227: The lights going on and off (2000). The exhibition will also include Work No 1701 (2013), a video work accompanied by Creed’s soundtrack 'You Return' and Work No 2316 (2015), a multi-coloured neon piece that spells out ‘Coconuts’, as well as a series of recent portrait paintings together with other significant loans from Tate and private lenders.
