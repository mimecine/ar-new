Discover Diane Arbus’s bold, direct approach to photography in North Devon

This is the first ARTIST ROOMS exhibition at the Burton in North Devon since the gallery’s Richard Long display, which opened in 2014. This year, the Burton presents Diane Arbus (1923–1971), one of the most influential photographers of the twentieth century. Born in New York City, she is best known for her black and white portraits of singular people. Arbus refused to take pictures of her subjects in ways that people wanted to see them. Her photography reveals the complexities of human nature and relationships, challenging ideas of gender, beauty and identity.
