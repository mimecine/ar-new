Martin Creed is among the most important British artists at work today, famous domestically and internationally for work that challenges our preconceptions about what art is and how we should engage with it.

This ARTIST ROOMS exhibition at Quay Arts will include works in a variety of media including a neon installation, 'Work No. 890 (Don’t Worry)' (2008), a twenty-one part drawing, 'Work No. 944' (2008) and a recent series of four paintings from 2011. Through Quay Arts’ involvement in the internationally renowned Isle of Wight Festival, Creed’s work will have the opportunity to reach new audiences, while Quay Arts will also forge partnerships with young people to engage them with Creed’s work.

This exhibition comes hard on the heels of major exhibitions of Creed's work at Hauser & Wirth, New York and Gavin Brown Enterprises, New York, as well as a summer retrospective of the artist's career at the Hayward Gallery, London.
