Jenny Holzer is known internationally as a pioneer of conceptual art, applying text in her work through a range of processes including painting, projection and her iconic LED works.

The exhibition showcases a range of pieces which depict recurring themes of violence, power, war, sex and money. The centrepiece of the exhibition is the towering piece BLUE PURPLE TILT; consisting of seven double sided vertical LED displays, this work acts almost as a retrospective of Holzer's work as it contains a selection of messages from several of her early text pieces.
