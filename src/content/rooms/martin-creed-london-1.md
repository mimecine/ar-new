Creed’s work challenges received understandings of how we experience art, and indeed what art 'is'. He asks us to question our role as viewers, the artist’s role and the way art is made, presented and perceived. In this installation, the absence of any fixed object on which to focus encourages the visitor to contemplate and reflect upon their own mood, meaning that the audience is as much responsible for the effect of the work as the artist.
