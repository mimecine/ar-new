Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum present the work of Diane Arbus, one of the most original and influential photographers of the 20th century. Famous for such photographs as Child with Toy Hand Grenade in Central Park, Arbus pioneered an approach which bridged a gap between documentary and fine art.

Born in New York in 1923, she began photographing in the 1940s with her first picture published in 1960. Over the next ten years she produced an extraordinary body of photographs which documented the diversity of human life.

Alongside the exhibition will be #humansofleamington, a project celebrating the creativity and diversity of Royal Leamington Spa and its communities. A series of 30 portraits of local creatives have been commissioned and will appear online and around Leamington Spa’s Old Town and Town Centre until December 2019. Audiences can get involved by tagging their own portraits on Instagram and Twitter with #humansofleamington. These will be featured in a display in the Royal Pump Rooms Foyer.
