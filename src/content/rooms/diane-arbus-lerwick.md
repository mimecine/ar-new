Shetland Museum and Archives presents an exhibition of Diane Arbus (1923-1971), one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century. This touring exhibition, delivered in partnership with Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland, brings together a remarkable body of her work from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, and offers a rare opportunity to see the artist’s iconic portraits, which celebrate the extraordinary in the ordinary.

An unmissable exhibition which was on display until 12 November 2023.
