The solo exhibition will be a collection of Bill Viola’s most well-known pieces from the Passions series, including: Four Hands, Surrender and Catherine’s Room. Viola is internationally recognised as having been instrumental in the establishment of video as a vital form of contemporary art - his work tends to be simple in style whilst making use of state-of-the-art technologies. His video works focus on universal human experiences—birth, death, and the unfolding of consciousness—and his pieces are shown in museums and galleries worldwide. This will be the first time that Bill Viola's artwork will be on show in Doncaster thanks to darts (Doncaster Community Arts).

The Point is home to Doncaster Community Arts (darts), a team of artists, makers, musicians, performers and support staff who design and deliver creative programmes. Together they inspire learning, build good emotional health and strengthen professional practice for people in Doncaster. The venue’s gallery shows a wide range of contemporary exhibitions, including this exhibition incollaboration with ARTIST ROOMS.
