Barnsley Civic Present the work of Diane Arbus, one of the most influential photographers of the twentieth century.

Born in 1923 in New York, Diane Arbus is widely considered to be a pioneer of the social documentary method of photography that blurred the line between art and reportage.

Her work records her love of diversity and capturing moments that personified the variety of attitudes, culture, lifestyle and appearances across society.

The body of work on show also provides a wonderful snapshot into the importance of trust and respect between photographer and subject; something Arbus held of great importance whilst capturing images of families, circus performers, nudists and eccentrics.
