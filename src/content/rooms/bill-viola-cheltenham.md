The Wilson is delighted to be exhibiting three works by Bill Viola from the collections of ARTIST ROOMS and the National Galleries of Scotland. The works provide a stimulus for debate around topics such as solitude/friendship, what is important to us; the spiritual and ritual, the personal and the global, offering young audiences the opportunity to draw parallels to their own lives.

The Wilson will aim to deliver an exciting and accessible exhibition and learning programme,showing that creativity can be an invaluable means for understanding more about yourself and the world around you. Our approach to learning activity builds upon our experience of previous projects to engage with young audiences, allowing them to respond to the exhibition creatively through a variety of media.
