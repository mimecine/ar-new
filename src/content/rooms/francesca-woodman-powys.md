ARTIST ROOMS: Francesca Woodman marks the first time that Oriel Davies, a key contemporary art gallery of Wales and the principal visual arts venue for the Mid Wales and Welsh Borders region, has worked with ARTIST ROOMS. Woodman’s work will be examined in depth, and further explored through working with other public collections.

American photographer Francesca Woodman has eighteen rare vintage black and white photographs in the ARTIST ROOMS display, from a collection once owned by the artist’s boyfriend. Woodman’s body of work, timeless despite the tragically early death of the artist, draws on traditions as varied as symbolism and surrealism, fashion photography and Baroque painting to express the experience of a brilliant young woman. The beauty and immediacy of these ethereal, troubling images is almost unparalleled in late twentieth century photography.

This presentation is ideally suited to a venue that is committed to presenting 'thought-provoking and challenging art by national and international artists in an environment that is welcoming, engaging, informative and free', and which has reputation for promoting young artists through its Test Bed programme of exhibitions.
