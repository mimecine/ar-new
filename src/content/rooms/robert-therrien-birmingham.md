Robert Therrien was an American artist known for his large-scale sculptures. His work reimagined and reinvented objects from everyday life, such as a set of table and chairs or stacks of plates, turning them into monumental immersive sculptures. Los Angeles–based, Therrien was described as being possessed by a sense of wonder over commonplace experiences.
