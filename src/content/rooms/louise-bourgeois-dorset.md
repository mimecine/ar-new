Dorset Museum presents ARTIST ROOMS: Louise Bourgeois, a touring exhibition celebrating one of the most celebrated and influential figures in modern and contemporary art. Louise Bourgeois (1911-2010) created a body of work over eight decades that was endlessly inventive, ranging from monumental installations to figurative sculptures and abstract collages. This exhibition has as its focus a collection of Bourgeois’s sculptures, drawings and prints made in the last twenty years of her life. Highlights at Dorset Museum will include the iconic Spider I 1995, Spirals 2005 and Cell XIV [Portrait] 2000.

Art is not about art. Art is about life, and that sums it up
