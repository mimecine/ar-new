Sol LeWitt was seminal in establishing the notion of ‘conceptual art’ during the 1960s. Wall Drawing #1136 Curved and straight color bands 2004 is one of a number of highly coloured wall pieces he made. It includes seven vibrant colours to create an overwhelming chromatic environment that envelopes the viewer. The curve snakes along the wall. Every band in the wall drawing is of the same width and there is no area left empty of colour.

It has been produced for Tate St Ives by a team of draftspersons, guided by an assistant from the artist’s estate.
