Showcasing the work of Scottish artist Douglas Gordon, winner of the Turner Prize in 1996.

Two works by renowned Scottish artist Douglas Gordon are presented within the context of Berwick’s former military gymnasium. Gordon’s major installation 10ms-1 (1994) contains footage of a medical film from the First World War, documenting the attempts of a psychologically injured man to stand up and walk, recording the real symptoms of war trauma. Showing alongside this is Looking down with his black, black, ee (2008), which takes its title from a popular Scottish poem about a bird sitting on a treetop, looking down on a group of children, suggesting foreboding menace. Much of Gordon’s work is about memory and uses repetition and material from the public realm to overturn traditional uses of video by playing with time elements and employing multiple monitors. This is the first time that Berwick Visual Arts have been part of the ARTIST ROOMS national exhibition programme.
