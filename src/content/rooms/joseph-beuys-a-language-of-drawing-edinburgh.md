The German artist, Joseph Beuys (1921-1986), is perhaps best known for his ‘actions’, installations and sculpture, but first and foremost he was an artist who was interested in ideas: ideas about how the world, both natural and social, functioned and how the latter could be improved. And the way that he expressed these ideas most readily was in his drawings.

This exhibition will bring together, for the first time, the extraordinary group of over 110 drawings by Beuys held in the ARTIST ROOMS collection. The drawings cover the whole of the artist’s career from 1945 to the end of his life, reflecting his encyclopaedic interest in nature, science, philosophy, mythology, society, politics and religion. This is the one of the largest and most important collections outside Germany by this key figure of post war art.

ARTIST ROOMS Joseph Beuys - A Language of Drawing is part of Edinburgh Art Festival.
