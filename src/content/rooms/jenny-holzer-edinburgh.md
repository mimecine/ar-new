In her first solo show in Scotland, Talbot Rice Gallery at the University of Edinburgh will show a small-scale monograph exhibition of the work of Jenny Holzer in the early spring of 2010.

Featuring the artist’s 2007 installation BLUE PURPLE TILT and paintings held in ARTIST ROOMS, the presentation will include additional keynote works from Tate and other collections to present characteristic political works in LED installation, redacted paintings, text works, posters and projection.
