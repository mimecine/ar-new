Discover the photographs of August Sander’s monumental project

ARTIST ROOMS August Sander presents over eighty photographs by August Sander drawn from his project, People of The Twentieth Century. The exhibition is one of three major photography exhibitions opening at National Museum Cardiff this autumn. The season brings together the work of four of the most influential photographers in the history of the medium, August Sander, Martin Parr, and Bernd and Hilla Becher.

Sander sought an honest portrayal of German society by photographing people of all ages and backgrounds; from farmers, policemen and politicians to bricklayers, secretaries and artists. The result is an ambitious body of work that captures, above all, the humanity of his subjects. His portraits celebrate the importance of the individual.

The exhibition is drawn from a major collection of over 170 modern prints, produced from the original plates by August Sander’s grandson, Gerd Sander, and placed on long loan to ARTIST ROOMS.

ARTIST ROOMS is a touring collection of over 1,600 works of modern and contemporary art. The collection is displayed across the UK in solo exhibitions that showcase the work of 42 major international artists.

The ARTIST ROOMS touring programme is delivered by the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate in a partnership with Ferens Art Gallery through to 2020, supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, by Art Fund and by the National Lottery through Creative Scotland.
