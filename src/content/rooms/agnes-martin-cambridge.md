The Canadian-American artist Agnes Martin was among the most important painters and drawers of her generation, with her simultaneously restrained and expressive work often thought of as a bridge between the schools of Abstract Expressionism and Minimalism that dominated painterly practice in the decades following the Second World War.

Although Martin’s works are in no way representational and the artist always insisted they held no references to landscape, she was inspired by Chinese Tao philosophy and the vast deserts of New Mexico where she resided for most of her life. ‘I want people, when they look at my paintings,’ she noted in 1993, ‘to have the same feelings they experience when they look at landscape… But it’s really about the feeling of beauty and freedom.’

The paintings in this exhibition are from her later years when bands of ethereal colour combined with the irregularities of hand-drawn grids. 'The paintings are very far from perfect - completely removed in fact - even as we ourselves are.'
