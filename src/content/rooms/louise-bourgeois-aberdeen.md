With a career spanning eight decades from the 1930s until 2010, Louise Bourgeois is one of the great figures of modern and contemporary art. She is best known for her large-scale sculptures and installations that are inspired by her own memories and experiences. Using drawings, prints, sculpture and fabric works from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, this exhibition takes an in-depth look at Bourgeois's work through the themes and ideas of an extraordinary artist.
