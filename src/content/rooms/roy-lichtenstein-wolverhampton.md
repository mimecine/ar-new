The major exhibition brings together Reflections: Art (1988) and sixteen large-scale screen-prints, and has been made possible through the generosity of the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation.
Purist Painting with Bottles (1975) – from Wolverhampton’s own acclaimed Pop Art Collection – will also feature in the exhibition, alongside the celebrated early painting In the Car (1963) and the painted steel relief Wall Explosion II (1965), on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate respectively.
