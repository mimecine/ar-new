Diane Arbus is acknowledged as one of the greats of twentieth-century American photography, renowned for her eerie, surreal and often disturbing portraits of marginalised characters. This three-room display of works drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection followed on from the 2010 ARTIST ROOMS exhibition of the hugely influential German photographer August Sander, a predecessor of Arbus in his determination to document every aspect of human society.

The exhibition presented a wide range of Arbus' work, stretching from photographs taken in the mid-1950s up to her untimely death in 1971.
