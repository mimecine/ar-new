As one of the most important post war European artists, Kiefer’s work encompasses themes of environment, identity and memory, often addressing the legacy and identity of Germany and individuals after World War II. This can be seen within the Heroic Symbols body of works which will be on show. The artist's use of natural materials such as lead, rope, ash and sand, bring an emotional and sculptural element to his paintings and photographs.

The exhibition features works spanning the past 40 years of Kiefer’s career, and this collection of ARTIST ROOMS works has rarely been on show outside of London.

To accompany the exhibition there will be a programme of talks and tours supported by a new young person’s group and creative development programme.
