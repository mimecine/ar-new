Alex Katz is one of the most important and respected living American artists, with a remarkable career spanning six decades. His elegant paintings present a modern, quintessentially American take on the classical themes of portraiture, landscape, figure studies, marine scenes and flowers. Katz's unique and immediately recognisable style, drawing on the Japanese, European and American traditions, is often cited as a forerunner of Pop Art, and this exhibition will provide viewers with the opportunity to see a substantial body of his work - featuring a group of large landscape paintings - alongside the other greats of twentieth century painting included in the Tate Modern's collection.

This displays coincides with an ARTIST ROOM exhibition of the work of Robert Mapplethorpe at Tate Modern, featuring important self-portraits shown for the first time.
