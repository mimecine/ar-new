A comprehensive selection of Robert Mapplethorpe's most famous photographs. The exhibition will range over his entire oeuvre including nudes, portraits, self-portraits and floral still life. Here you will find the famous and the infamous including some of his best known portraits. Mapplethorpe's choices were both innovative and bold. His cutting-edge use of natural light and challenging themes has become embedded in our culture with pervasive echoes not only in the work of other artists but in mainstream advertising and rock music imagery.
