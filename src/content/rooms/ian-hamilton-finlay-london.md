This ARTIST ROOM featured Ian Hamilton Finlay’s monumental one-room installation 'Sailing Dinghy' (1996), which comprises a full-sized sailing boat and poem. The boat, which Hamilton Finlay sailed himself, measures over five metres tall and four metres wide, while a poem forms a ‘key’ that describes the parts of the boat and evokes its movement.

His work, often collaborative and in a wide variety of materials, is a unique blend of art and poetry - this installation combined his love of ships and the sea with his love of literature and the potency of words.
