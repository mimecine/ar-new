Jannis Kounellis is a painter, performance artist and sculptor best known as an influential figure of arte povera, a radical and revolutionary movement that emerged in Italy during the 1960s and questioned the value of art and culture that appealed only to a wealthy or 'cultivated' elite.

This exhibition of sculptures at Tramway, Glasgow drew together some of the most significant works from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, including 'Untitled' 2004, alongside new site-specific work. The artist's work with industrial materials relates closely to the exhibition site and the manufacturing heritage of this great Scottish city.
