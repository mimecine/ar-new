Richard Long first came to prominence during the late 1960s and was one of the generation of British artists who wanted to extend the possibilities of sculpture beyond the confines of the gallery and the employment of traditional art materials. His work is rooted in his deep affinity with nature, developed during solitary walks.

Although much of his work is made in the landscape and known through photography, Long also brings natural materials into the gallery space. 'Somerset Willow Line' and 'Cornish Slate Ellipse', both included in this ARTIST ROOMS exhibition at the Hepworth Wakefield, are two key examples of works made specifically for an architectural setting.
