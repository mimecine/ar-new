This was the first significant exhibition of Andy Warhol’s work in Northern Ireland, drawing on the ARTIST ROOMS’ impressive selection of 232 works which span the artist’s body of work. A unique selection of late diptychs, as well as the celebrated four-part 'Camouflage' (1986), took pride of place in this presentation.

The power of Warhol’s work comes from its focus on fundamental human themes – the beauty and glamour of youth and fame, material culture, the passing of time and the presence of death. Employing mass-production techniques, Warhol challenged preconceived notions about the nature of art and erased traditional distinctions between fine art and popular culture.

A selection of spectacular stitched photographs alongside a series of intriguing Polaroid self-portraits highlighted his photographic work. The collection was complemented by 126 Warhol posters from all periods of the artist’s career, including his films and popular imagery from some of Warhol’s most famous works including 'Mao', 'Hamburger' and 'Cow wallpaper' and references to the famous nightclub, Studio 54.

The exhibition was accompanied by the screening of films including 'My Hustler' (1965), 'Empire' (1964), 'Eat' (1963), 'Sleep' (1963), and 'Beauty No 2' (1965).
