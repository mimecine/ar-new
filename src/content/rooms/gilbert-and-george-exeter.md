Gilbert (b Dolomites, Italy, 1943) and George (b Devon, 1942) met in 1967 as students at St Martin's School of Art in London. By 1969 they were reacting against approaches to sculpture then dominant at St Martin's, which they regarded as elitist and poor at communicating outside an art context. Their strategy was to make themselves into sculpture, so sacrificing their separate identities to art and turning the notion of creativity on its head.

This exhibition represents several major aspects of the artists’ career from 1969 to 1991. RAMM will be the first Artist Rooms Associate to hold a Gilbert & George exhibition. It continues RAMM’s tradition of creative programming and desire to work with partners to present the best in contemporary art to audiences in Exeter and wider westcountry region.
