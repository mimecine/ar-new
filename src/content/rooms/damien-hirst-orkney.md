A selection of Damien Hirst works held by ARTISTS ROOMS will be displayed at the Pier Arts Centre, Stromness, Orkney in summer 2015. The exhibition will provide an opportunity to view Hirst’s work alongside the Centre’s Collection of 20th and 21st century Modernist art and in particular to highlight the connections between Hirst and Margaret Mellis – she was a close friend and mentor of Hirst’s during the development of his early career.

The Centre’s exhibitions and the Mellis works in the gallery’s collection will allow new readings of both artists’ work providing a challenging and rewarding experience for audiences in the far north of the UK.

A learning programme exploring the relationships between Hirst and Mellis’s work will be developed in collaboration with the Centre’s Piergroup (16-25 year olds) who have been involved in the two previous ARTIST ROOMS presentations at the Centre.
