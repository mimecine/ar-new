Following, the display of Ian Hamilton Finlayâ€™s work, the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art presented rooms dedicated to the work of American artist Robert Therrien and the renowned British duo Gilbert & George. These presentations formed part of an ongoing and extensive re-hang of the twentieth- and twenty-first- century permanent collection displays at the Gallery of Modern Art, to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the gallery.
