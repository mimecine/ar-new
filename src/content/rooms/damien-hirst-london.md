Damien Hirst first came to public attention in London in 1988 when he conceived and curated Freeze, an exhibition in a disused warehouse which showed his work and that of his friends and fellow students at Goldsmiths College. In the nearly quarter of a century since that pivotal show, Hirst has become one of the most influential artists of his generation.

His work will be amongst the ARTIST ROOMS displays presented as part of the BP British Art Displays 1500-2010 at Tate Britain.
