Southampton City Art Gallery is pleased to be the first ARTIST ROOMS Associate in the south to show works by the French-American artist Louise Bourgeois. This will be the second opportunity for the city of Southampton to benefit from and engage with the work of a contemporary artist included within the ARTIST ROOMS collection, since the success of the Andy Warhol exhibition in 2011.

This exhibition will reveal how Bourgeois, working in a variety of materials and scales, explores the mystery and beauty of human emotions. Drawing upon recurring themes and motifs such as spirals, spiders, the human form and womanhood we hope to provide audiences with the opportunity to connect and engage with the deeply personal and emotive issues Bourgeois explored.

Integral to this exhibition will be an innovative educational programme of projects and events which will engage and inspire young people.
