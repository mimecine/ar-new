A pioneer of the Pop Art movement that exploded in the 1960’s, Lichtenstein’s influence is still widely seen today. Creating often monumentally sized paintings using his signature hand-painted dots, Lichtenstein’s style mimicked the Ben-Day dot aesthetics of comic books and commercial newsprint, becoming synonymous with the pervasive and accelerating effects of popular mass culture at the time. Sometimes incorporating text, his paintings and prints use irony and cliché to reflect on the contemporary conditions of his day, from obsessions with youth and beauty, to the socio-political context in which he found himself working.

ARTIST ROOMS Roy Lichtenstein has been developed in partnership with Tate and National Galleries Scotland, and provides a rare opportunity to see such a substantial collection of Lichtenstein’s work in the north of England. This solo exhibition showcases a key body of his work which has been placed on long loan to the ARTIST ROOMS collection by the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation.
