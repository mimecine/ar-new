Recognised as one of Germany’s most significant living artists, Gerhard Richter consistently identifies himself as a painter. His ongoing investigation into the process of painting started over 50 years ago in 1960. This exhibition will examine the breadth and depth of his practice and techniques, and will focus on the three broad areas of activity in his work: figurative, constructive and abstract.



Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery is aiming to involve young people in a range of areas including the development of the exhibition and the production of its marketing and interpretation materials as well as through a programme of public events.
