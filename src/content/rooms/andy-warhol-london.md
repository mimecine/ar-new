This exhibition presented a selection of Andy Warhol paintings recently acquired by ARTIST ROOMS, including self-portraits and the iconic multi-part work 'Skulls'. The works emphasise Warhol's increasing preoccupation with themes of death and mortality in the later part of his career, exacerbated by the near-fatal shooting he suffered in 1968.

This presentation opened alongside an ARTIST ROOMS exhibition at the Tate Modern devoted to one of the most significant female American artists of the last fifty years, Agnes Martin.
