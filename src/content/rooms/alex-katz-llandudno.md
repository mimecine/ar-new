The American painter Alex Katz began working in the 1950s, focusing on figurative subjects which set him apart from the avant-garde mainstream but brought him public recognition in the 1980s when many young artists began to work in related ways. Although best-known for large-scale portraits, painted in his distinctive, stylised manner, Katz has also consistently made small paintings, many of them conceived initially as studies, which can be considered as a distinct body of work.

Katz has twenty such small paintings in the ARTIST ROOMS collection, which span his career. All of the portraits in the collection depict the artistsâ€™ friends or family, including his son Vincent, a habitual model for Katz since his birth in 1960, and many of the landscapes derive from the Maine coast, where Katz has spent summers since the beginning of his career.
