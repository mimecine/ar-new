Shetland Museum & Archives and Shetland Arts Development Agency will exhibit work by internationally acclaimed photojournalist Don McCullin. This will be the first ARTIST ROOMS exhibition of these powerful images. McCullin worked for over 20 years documenting conflict throughout the world including; Vietnam, Cyprus, Northern Ireland and Beirut. For McCullin, the work wasn’t simply about the photographs, but about humanity. The issues raised by these images will be used by local young people to develop new projects inspired by this exhibition by one of the greatest photojournalists of all time.

This is part of a joint exhibition with Bonhoga Gallery.
