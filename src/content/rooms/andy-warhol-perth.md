Early drawings, stitched photographs, prints and posters by Andy Warhol were brought together to focus on the themes of film, fashion and celebrity in the work of this seminal artist. The exhibition included key images from Warhol’s career such as The Nation’s Nightmare 1951, Happy Butterfly Day 1955, Marilyn Monroe 1962, Cow 1976 and a selection of self-portraits. Works encompassed the designs Warhol created for fashion magazines, portraits of the rich and famous and the cutting-edge film productions of his Factory in New York.
