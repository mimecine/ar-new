Works by Richard Long will be shown in the newly refurbished Ulster Museum which reopened to the public in October 2009 after a three year £17 million redevelopment project. Long has been a major figure in international and British art since the late 1960s. This focused exhibition will include a range of works from ARTIST ROOMS to explore the artist’s ongoing concern with landscape and the natural environment.
