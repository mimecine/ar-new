Presenting key works by international artists in the far west of Cornwall is a cornerstone of Newlyn Art Gallery & The Exchange’s programme. For its first ARTIST ROOMS project, The Exchange will exhibit the work of American artist, Robert Therrien. Born in 1947, he lives and works in Los Angeles. He is perhaps best known for his work which examines the viewer’s relationship to scale, and which often also allude to modest household items.



Therrien’s works explore the space between reality and the world of dreams, drawing the viewer into the realm of fables and fairytales, childhood games and unfinished narratives. The immediacy, accessibility and playful relationship with childhood in Therrien’s work offer huge potential for The Exchange to build upon its track record for engaging young people with contemporary art.
