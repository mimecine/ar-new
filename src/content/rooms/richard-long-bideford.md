Nestled within a stunning rural location, the Burton Art Gallery and Museum is the largest purpose built space between Bristol and St Ives on the north coast, delivering an ambitious mix of programming from internationally renowned artists and institutional partners to local schools and open selections.

Richard Long, one of Britain’s most significant artists, has strong connections with the South West and his work often uses the materials that make up our environment. The exhibition at Burton Art Gallery and Museum includes a number works made in the landscape through the medium of walking, an activity synonymous with North Devon as well as the important sculpture Cornish Slate Ellipse, 2009.

The Burton is owned and managed by Torridge District Council and the exhibition programme is generously supported by The Friends of the Burton.
