ARTIST ROOMS: Roy Lichtenstein travels to The Hatton Gallery in Newcastle who present the work of Roy Lichtenstein in autumn 2019.

Focusing on the arresting, emotionally charged and ambiguous imagery typically found in romance and war comics, Lichtenstein believed the world of images could be reduced to abstract patterning while retaining their original intent as recognisable symbols of reality. Lichtenstein at once draws on art history while also responding to cultural and political change from the 1960s onwards.

Bringing together works from throughout Lichtenstein’s career, the exhibition showcases a key body of works on long loan from the Roy Lichtenstein Foundation to ARTIST ROOMS, a collection of international modern and contemporary art which is jointly owned by Tate and the National Galleries of Scotland, alongside major loans from both institutions.
