Through his use of everyday items such as vacuum cleaners and basketballs and later by creating oversized kitsch objects, the American artist Jeff Koons conveys the power of consumer industries and explores the aesthetics and culture of taste. Since the 1980s, the artist has made use of references reminiscent of pop art in his use of popular imagery and in his means of production. His brightly coloured sculptures and reliefs, often employing highly reflective surfaces and made with extraordinary precision, also recall the heady excesses of the Baroque.

This extended display at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art brought together the major group of works by Koons held in ARTIST ROOMS. From the early New Hoover Convertibles, Green, Red, Brown, New Shelton Wet/Dry 10 Gallon Displaced Doubledecker 1981-7, to the basketball piece Encased - Four Rows 1983-93, to Winter Bears 1988 and a selection of works from his Made in Heaven series, the collection offers the opportunity for audiences to explore some of the artist’s most important and iconic series.
