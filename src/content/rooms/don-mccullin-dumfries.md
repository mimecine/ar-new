Don McCullin is one of the world’s greatest photojournalists, famous around the world for his work in conflict zones from Northern Ireland to Vietnam.

The photographs in ARTIST ROOMS exemplify McCullin’s ability to bring his audience almost unbearably close to the experience of people living under conditions that we can barely imagine. His work documents the second part of a century riven by war, mass emigration, famine and political upheaval on a vast scale, focusing on the particular and in each case unique plight of individual men, women and children.
