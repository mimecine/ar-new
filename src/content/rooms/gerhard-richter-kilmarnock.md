This exhibition at the Dick Institute, Dumfries, will present a selection of work by the great German painter Gerhard Richter. Regularly cited as the most important painter alive today, Gerhard Richter's work over the past fifty years has sought to examine the very nature of painting as a practice. Addressing subject matter both abstract and representational, often using photography as a starting point, he has mastered an extraordinary variety of painterly techniques, drawing on traditions of photorealism, abstract expressionism and conceptualism in his paintings. He is an artist capable of changing the way that we think about painting, attractive to both admirers of technical expertise in painting and lovers of new ideas.

Opened in 1901, the Dick Institute is one of the most important cultural venues in the south-west of Scotland, featuring the largest museum and galleries in Ayrshire. It also contains reference and lending libraries.
