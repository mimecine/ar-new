Discover this must-see exhibition of works from Alex Katz (born 1927), a highly recognisable and admired artist who has inspired generations of artists and influenced advertising and popular culture since coming to public attention in 1950s New York.

With their bright and bold palette, Katz’s paintings present a modern American take on the classical themes of portraiture, landscape and flowers. His immediately recognisable style draws on American and European painting traditions and is influenced by the work of Matisse and Monet. At the same time, the crisp stylised surfaces of the paintings have an affinity with pop art.

This must-see exhibition features works selected from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, providing viewers with the opportunity to see Katz’s trademark portraits and some lesser known, large scale landscapes, here in Carlisle for the first time.
