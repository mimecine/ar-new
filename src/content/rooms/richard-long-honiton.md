Explore the relationship between people and the natural world

Richard Long (b. 1945) is one of the most influential artists of our time. This exhibition features work from 1966–2006, starting with early experiments in the south-west of England. He began a life-long investigation into landscape as both space and material, going to locations across the world. His work includes photography, maps, and texts, to mark-making and sculpture.

The exhibition is accompanied by an ambitious learning and events programme marking the beginning of Thelma Hulbert Gallery’s Culture and Climate 2020 Programme. This was in response to Devon’s climate change emergency declaration. The gallery will deliver a series of exhibitions, projects and events across East Devon that discuss and explore this issue.

The ARTIST ROOMS touring programme is delivered by the National Galleries of Scotland and Tate, supported using public funding by the National Lottery through Arts Council England, by Art Fund and by the National Lottery through Creative Scotland.
