American artist Jeff Koons (b.1955) is one of the most internationally renowned artists working today. Almost unrivalled in terms of commercial success, Koons fittingly started his career in New York as a commodities broker. In the 1980s he established himself as an artist, setting up a studio with assistants and operating in a way similar to Andy Warholâ€™s Factory.

Using everyday items and oversized images from popular culture, Koons explores ideas of culture and taste, questioning the established values of the art world. Not one to shun publicity, Koons has become the ultimate poster-boy for consumerism, making himself as much a commodity as the art he creates.
