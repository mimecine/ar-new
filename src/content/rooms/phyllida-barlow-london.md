untitled: upturnedhouse, 2 2012 is made of painted wood panels that are built up to form an irregular structure. Though the title refers to a house, it has become an abstracted form, a familiar object removed from its practical function. The materials themselves can also be deceptive. The two wedge-shaped elements that support the structure appear to be concrete, but are in fact made of wood with a surface coating of cement.

The construction looks as if it may collapse or tip over at any moment, flagrantly disobeying the rules of balance, symmetry, gravity and beauty associated with more classical forms of sculpture and architecture. Often described as ‘anti-monumental’, Barlow’s sculptures confront us with their physical presence and irreverence.
