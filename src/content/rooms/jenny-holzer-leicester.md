American artist Jenny Holzer is renowned for thought-provoking, text-based installations that incorporate diverse media and a pioneering use of electronic technologies.

Born in 1950, Holzer remains one of the most influential figures in contemporary art. Her work has taken many forms, often appearing in public spaces, T-shirts, carved stone, signs and large scale outdoor projections, as well as in museums and galleries across the world. Confronting current events and topics such as war and sexual violence in her work, Holzer is uncompromising in her search for truth and exposure of systems of power and control.

The centrepiece of the exhibition will be the towering BLUE PURPLE TILT 2007, consisting of seven double-sided vertical LED displays programmed with a selection of messages from her previous works.

A leading centre for contemporary art situated on the University of Leicester campus, Attenborough Arts Centre engages 100,000 public visitors per year with year-round artistic programmes and a longstanding mission to make culture and creativity accessible for all.
