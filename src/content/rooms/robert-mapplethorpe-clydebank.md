Clydebank Museum and Art Gallery is working for the first time with ARTIST ROOMS to host an exhibition of photographs by American artist Robert Mapplethorpe.

The ARTIST ROOMS collection of Mapplethorpe photographs is one of the best in the world. This exhibition showcases a series of iconic self-portraits - a concentration unique to ARTIST ROOMS - some of which are on show for the first time outside Tate Modern. In addition, the exhibition features a number of beautifully captured portraits of Mapplethorpe’s contemporaries form the wider art world during the 1970s and 1980s: influential artists, writers and musicians including Andy Warhol, Truman Capote and Patti Smith.

As well as bringing exciting and challenging contemporary art to Clydebank, this exhibition will also serve as the focus for a programme of learning activities and events that will explore Mapplethorpe’s work and his wider influences.
