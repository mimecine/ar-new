ARTIST ROOMS Diane Arbus is a touring exhibition that brings together a remarkable body of work by the influential American photographer. Featuring some of Arbus’s most iconic black and white portraits, the exhibition celebrates her enduring influence in the year that marks the centenary of her birth.

Arbus is considered one of the great figures of American photography. She documented the lives, appearances and emotions of people, celebrating the extraordinary in the ordinary. The exhibition spans the breadth of Arbus’s career, beginning with early works from the mid-1950s taken with a 35mm camera, to the distinctive square format she adopted from 1962. A highlight in the exhibition is A box of ten photographs 1969–71, a rare portfolio of original prints which Arbus selected to represent who she was as an artist and how she saw her work in the world.

North Hertfordshire Museum, located in Hitchin, showcases the rich history of North Hertfordshire, with art and heritage displays and regularly changing exhibitions across its four galleries. North Hertfordshire Museum is the final venue of this exhibition tour, and the first in the south of the UK.
