Sol LeWitt was a pioneer of Conceptual Art and Minimalism. The monumental and colourful Wall Drawing #1136 from the ARTIST ROOMS collection was first installed at Fraenkel Gallery, San Francisco in 2004 and is a late example of LeWittâ€™s work, where vibrantly coloured bands are painted directly onto the wall of the gallery space.

The work will be installed at Turner Contemporary across two walls of the Clore Learning Studio. The gallery was designed by UK architect David Chipperfield and opened in April 2011.
