Firstsite, the last venue to open an ARTIST ROOMS exhibition as part of the 2013–2016 touring cycle, will present the work of Andy Warhol, on show from 19th March 2016.

Key works spanning Andy Warhol’s forty year career will be on display including large silkscreen paintings, early ink drawings and self-portraits. For the duration of the exhibition, Firstsite’s Auditorium will screen seminal Warhol films and host a series of related talks and events.

Alongside the main exhibition, contemporary artists and designers have been invited to respond to Warhol’s work across the building. These projects will take the form of an architectural intervention by Op-Pop designer Camille Walala and a solo exhibition by Colchester-born Hattie Stewart.
