This ARTIST ROOMS exhibition at the Harris Museum & Art Gallery includes Changing Light Corridor With Rooms, last exhibited in the UK in 1989. Representing the breadth of his practice from the 1970s to the 1990s, the exhibition features pieces which focus on body language, word play and repetitive gesture.

The works have been selected by Young Harris, the museum's youth arts group for people aged 13-18. The museum will work with a number of diverse groups on the interpretation of the work, focusing on the use of hands and expression in communication.

The Harris Museum & Art Gallery is a Preston City Council Service. On the outside of the building is the inscription: ‘The mental riches you may here acquire abide with you always’. Its permanent collection includes work by Walter Sickert, Graham Sutherland, David Jones and Lucian Freud.
