An ARTIST ROOMS Partnership Exhibition with Tate and National Galleries of Scotland

In celebration of its 25th Anniversary, MK Gallery is delighted to present Andy Warhol: Portrait of America, an ARTIST ROOMS Partnership Exhibition with Tate and National Galleries of Scotland, opening Saturday 15 March 2025.

Almost 25 years since Andy Warhol: Cars was shown in 2001, MK Gallery is set to exhibit the seminal pop artist’s work once again in Milton Keynes. This upcoming exhibition will be a survey of over 130 of Warhol’s most iconic artworks, including the renowned Marilyn series, and two paintings of British art duo Gilbert & George, who were the focus of MK Gallery’s inaugural exhibition in 1999.
