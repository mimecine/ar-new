ARTIST ROOMS: Ron Mueck is part of SKIN, a presentation of work by internationally acclaimed artists, exploring the nude and how the depiction of skin continues to fascinate today.

​Ron Mueck’s striking, meticulously crafted sculptures of the human form, including Wild Man (2005), Spooning Couple, (2005) and Poke (2017), reflect the artist's ability to convey powerful psychological depth and intensity through his work.
