Influential British artist Richard Long (born 1945) makes art based on the action of walking in the natural landscape. Since the 1960s, he has created works in remote regions in Britain and all over the world, which are documented by photography or words. He has used maps, drawn lines, and photographs to articulate processes of measuring time and space.

This exhibition, drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, is an opportunity to explore the artist's work, set against the backdrop of Derby and the Peak district.
