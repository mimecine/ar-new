ARTIST ROOMS Martin Creed presents highlights from the British artist’s thirty-year career. Born in in 1968, and raised in Glasgow, Creed came to prominence in 2001 when he won the Turner prize and he is recognised internationally for his playful, thought-provoking, and deeply ambiguous approach to art.

Artist, musician, composer and performer, Creed's multi-disciplinary practice draws on the everyday, transforming common materials and actions into surprising meditations on existence, choice and perception. His art continually overturns our expectations and is characterised by his subversive wit. The exhibition will feature sculpture, neon works, painting and video, offering an insight into one of the most innovative artists working today.

The Dick Institute is a museum and library in Kilmarnock, Scotland. It houses the largest gallery spaces in Ayrshire and features a programme of touring exhibitions, permanent collection and displays and innovative work by local contemporary artists.
