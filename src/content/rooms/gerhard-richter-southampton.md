John Hansard Gallery’s new building opens with a major exhibition by Gerhard Richter.

The gallery in Southampton is celebrating the opening of its new expanded and purpose-built gallery with this inaugural exhibition. All spaces within the new gallery will be devoted to Gerhard Richter’s works drawn from the ARTIST ROOMS collection, and several aspects of his practice will be represented, including painting, photography, and print. Richter (b. 1932) is one of the world’s most significant artists of the 20th and 21st centuries: the exhibition will be a serious examination of the artist’s work, bringing it to new audiences and demonstrating his immense ongoing influence and significance to subsequent generations of artists.
