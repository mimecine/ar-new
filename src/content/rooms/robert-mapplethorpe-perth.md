ARTIST ROOMS on Tour with The Art Fund supported by the Scottish Government is an inspired partnership that will fulfil the vision for this extraordinary collection: that it should be shared across the UK.

Photographs by American artist Robert Mapplethorpe is on show at Perth Museum & Art Gallery as part of Mapplethorpe Scottish Tour. The ARTISTS ROOMS collection includes flower studies and portraits of many of the most influential artists, writers and musicians of the period, alongside several iconic self portraits – in particular a poignant portrait of Mapplethorpe shortly before his death from an AIDS-related illness in 1989.
